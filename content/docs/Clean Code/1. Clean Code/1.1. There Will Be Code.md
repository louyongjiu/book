## 1.1 要有代码

One might argue that a book about code is somehow behind the times—that code is no longer the issue; that we should be concerned about models and requirements instead. Indeed some have suggested that we are close to the end of code. That soon all code will be generated instead of written. That programmers simply won’t be needed because business people will generate programs from specifications.

> 有人也许会以为，关于代码的书有点儿落后于时代——代码不再是问题；我们应当关注模型和需求。确实，有人说过我们正在临近代码的终结点。很快，代码就会自动产生出来，不需要再人工编写。程序员完全没用了，因为商务人士可以从规约直接生成程序。

Nonsense! We will never be rid of code, because code represents the details of the requirements. At some level those details cannot be ignored or abstracted; they have to be specified. And specifying requirements in such detail that a machine can execute them is programming. Such a specification is code.

> 扯淡！我们永远抛不掉代码，因为代码呈现了需求的细节。在某些层面上，这些细节无法被忽略或抽象，必须明确之。将需求明确到机器可以执行的细节程度，就是编程要做的事。而这种规约正是代码。

I expect that the level of abstraction of our languages will continue to increase. I also expect that the number of domain-specific languages will continue to grow. This will be a good thing. But it will not eliminate code. Indeed, all the specifications written in these higher level and domain-specific language will be code! It will still need to be rigorous, accurate, and so formal and detailed that a machine can understand and execute it.

> 我期望语言的抽象程度继续提升。我也期望领域特定语言的数量继续增加。那会是好事一桩。但那终结不了代码。实际上，在较高层次上用领域特定语言撰写的规约也将是代码！它也得严谨、精确、规范和详细，好让机器理解和执行。

The folks who think that code will one day disappear are like mathematicians who hope one day to discover a mathematics that does not have to be formal. They are hoping that one day we will discover a way to create machines that can do what we want rather than what we say. These machines will have to be able to understand us so well that they can translate vaguely specified needs into perfectly executing programs that precisely meet those needs.

> 那帮以为代码终将消失的伙计，就像是巴望着发现一种无规范数学的数学家们一般。他们巴望着，总有一天能创造出某种机器，我们只要想想、嘴都不用张就能叫它依计行事。那机器要能透彻理解我们，只有这样，它才能把含糊不清的需求翻译为可完美执行的程序，精确满足需求。

This will never happen. Not even humans, with all their intuition and creativity, have been able to create successful systems from the vague feelings of their customers. Indeed, if the discipline of requirements specification has taught us anything, it is that well-specified requirements are as formal as code and can act as executable tests of that code!

> 这种事永远不会发生。即便是人类，倾其全部的直觉和创造力，也造不出满足客户模糊感觉的成功系统来。如果说需求规约原则教给了我们什么，那就是归置良好的需求就像代码一样正式，也能作为代码的可执行测试来使用。

Remember that code is really the language in which we ultimately express the requirements. We may create languages that are closer to the requirements. We may create tools that help us parse and assemble those requirements into formal structures. But we will never eliminate necessary precision—so there will always be code.

> 记住，代码确然是我们最终用来表达需求的那种语言。我们可以创造各种与需求接近的语言。我们可以创造帮助把需求解析和汇整为正式结构的各种工具。然而，我们永远无法抛弃必要的精确性——所以代码永存。
