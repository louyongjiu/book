## 1.2 糟糕的代码

I was recently reading the preface to Kent Beck’s book Implementation Patterns.1 He says, “… this book is based on a rather fragile premise: that good code matters….” A fragile premise? I disagree! I think that premise is one of the most robust, supported, and overloaded of all the premises in our craft (and I think Kent knows it). We know good code matters because we’ve had to deal for so long with its lack.

> 最近我在读 Kent Beck 著 Implementation Patterns（中译版《实现模式》）[1]一书的序言。他这样写道：“……本书基于一种不太牢靠的前提：好代码的确重要……”这前提不牢靠？我反对！我认为这是该领域最强固、最受支持、最被强调的前提了（我想 Kent 也知道）。我们知道好代码重要，是因为其短缺实在困扰了我们太久。

I know of one company that, in the late 80s, wrote a killer app. It was very popular, and lots of professionals bought and used it. But then the release cycles began to stretch. Bugs were not repaired from one release to the next. Load times grew and crashes increased. I remember the day I shut the product down in frustration and never used it again. The company went out of business a short time after that.

> 20 世纪 80 年代末，有家公司写了个很流行的杀手应用，许多专业人士都买来用。然后，发布周期开始拉长。缺陷总是不能修复。装载时间越来越久，崩溃的几率也越来越大。至今我还记得自己在某天沮丧地关掉那个程序，从此再不用它。在那之后不久，该公司就关门大吉了。

Two decades later I met one of the early employees of that company and asked him what had happened. The answer confirmed my fears. They had rushed the product to market and had made a huge mess in the code. As they added more and more features, the code got worse and worse until they simply could not manage it any longer. It was the bad code that brought the company down.

> 20 年后，我见到那家公司的一位早期雇员，问他当年发生了什么事。他的回答叫我愈发恐惧起来。原来，当时他们赶着推出产品，代码写得乱七八糟。特性越加越多，代码也越来越烂，最后再也没法管理这些代码了。是糟糕的代码毁了这家公司。

Have you ever been significantly impeded by bad code? If you are a programmer of any experience then you’ve felt this impediment many times. Indeed, we have a name for it. We call it wading. We wade through bad code. We slog through a morass of tangled brambles and hidden pitfalls. We struggle to find our way, hoping for some hint, some clue, of what is going on; but all we see is more and more senseless code.

> 你是否曾为糟糕的代码所深深困扰？如果你是位有点儿经验的程序员，定然多次遇到过这类困境。我们有专用来形容这事的词：沼泽（wading）。我们趟过代码的水域。我们穿过灌木密布、瀑布暗藏的沼泽地。我们拼命想找到出路，期望有点什么线索能启发我们到底发生了什么事；但目光所及，只是越来越多死气沉沉的代码。

Of course you have been impeded by bad code. So then—why did you write it?

> 你当然曾为糟糕的代码所困扰过。那么——为什么要写糟糕的代码呢？

Were you trying to go fast? Were you in a rush? Probably so. Perhaps you felt that you didn’t have time to do a good job; that your boss would be angry with you if you took the time to clean up your code. Perhaps you were just tired of working on this program and wanted it to be over. Or maybe you looked at the backlog of other stuff that you had promised to get done and realized that you needed to slam this module together so you could move on to the next. We’ve all done it.

> 是想快点完成吗？是要赶时间吗？有可能。或许你觉得自己要干好所需的时间不够；假使花时间清理代码，老板就会大发雷霆。或许你只是不耐烦再搞这套程序，期望早点结束。或许你看了看自己承诺要做的其他事，意识到得赶紧弄完手上的东西，好接着做下一件工作。这种事我们都干过。

We’ve all looked at the mess we’ve just made and then have chosen to leave it for another day. We’ve all felt the relief of seeing our messy program work and deciding that a working mess is better than nothing. We’ve all said we’d go back and clean it up later. Of course, in those days we didn’t know LeBlanc’s law: Later equals never.

> 我们都曾经瞟一眼自己亲手造成的混乱，决定弃之而不顾，走向新一天。我们都曾经看到自己的烂程序居然能运行，然后断言能运行的烂程序总比什么都没有强。我们都曾经说过有朝一日再回头清理。当然，在那些日子里，我们都没听过勒布朗（LeBlanc）法则：稍后等于永不（Later equals never）。
