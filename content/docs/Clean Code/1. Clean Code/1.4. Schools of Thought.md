## 1.4 思想流派

What about me (Uncle Bob)? What do I think clean code is? This book will tell you, in hideous detail, what I and my compatriots think about clean code. We will tell you what we think makes a clean variable name, a clean function, a clean class, etc. We will present these opinions as absolutes, and we will not apologize for our stridence. To us, at this point in our careers, they are absolutes. They are our school of thought about clean code.

> 我（鲍勃大叔）又是怎么想的呢？在我眼中整洁代码是什么样的？本书将以详细到吓死人的程度告诉你，我和我的同道对整洁代码的看法。我们会告诉你关于整洁变量名的想法，关于整洁函数的想法，关于整洁类的想法，如此等等。我们视这些观点为当然，且不为其逆耳而致歉。对我们而言，在职业生涯的这个阶段，这些观点确属当然，也是我们整洁代码派的圭旨。

Martial artists do not all agree about the best martial art, or the best technique within a martial art. Often master martial artists will form their own schools of thought and gather students to learn from them. So we see Gracie Jiu Jistu, founded and taught by the Gracie family in Brazil. We see Hakkoryu Jiu Jistu, founded and taught by Okuyama Ryuho in Tokyo. We see Jeet Kune Do, founded and taught by Bruce Lee in the United States.

> 武术家从不认同所谓最好的武术，也不认同所谓绝招。武术大师们常常创建自己的流派，聚徒而授。因此我们才看到格雷西家族在巴西开创并传授的格雷西柔术（Gracie Jiu Jistu），看到奥山龙峰（Okuyama Ryuho）在东京开创并传授的八光流柔术（Hakkoryu Jiu Jistu），看到李小龙（Bruce Lee）在美国开创并传授的截拳道（Jeet Kune Do）。

Students of these approaches immerse themselves in the teachings of the founder. They dedicate themselves to learn what that particular master teaches, often to the exclusion of any other master’s teaching. Later, as the students grow in their art, they may become the student of a different master so they can broaden their knowledge and practice. Some eventually go on to refine their skills, discovering new techniques and founding their own schools.

> 弟子们沉浸于创始人的授业。他们全心师从某位师傅，排斥其他师傅。弟子有所成就后，可以转投另一位师傅，扩展自己的知识与技能。有些弟子最终百炼成钢，创出新招数，开宗立派。

None of these different schools is absolutely right. Yet within a particular school we act as though the teachings and techniques are right. After all, there is a right way to practice Hakkoryu Jiu Jitsu, or Jeet Kune Do. But this rightness within a school does not invalidate the teachings of a different school.

> 任何门派都并非绝对正确。不过，身处某一门派时，我们总以其所传之技为善。归根结底，练习八光流柔术或截拳道，自有其善法，但这并不能否定其他门派所授之法。

Consider this book a description of the Object Mentor School of Clean Code. The techniques and teachings within are the way that we practice our art. We are willing to claim that if you follow these teachings, you will enjoy the benefits that we have enjoyed, and you will learn to write code that is clean and professional. But don’t make the mistake of thinking that we are somehow “right” in any absolute sense. There are other schools and other masters that have just as much claim to professionalism as we. It would behoove you to learn from them as well.

> 可以把本书看作是对象导师（Object Mentor）整洁代码派的说明。里面要传授的就是我们勤操己艺的方法。如果你遵从这些教诲，你就会如我们一般乐受其益，你将学会如何编写整洁而专业的代码。但无论如何也别错以为我们是“正确的”。其他门派和师傅和我们一样专业。你有必要也向他们学习。

Indeed, many of the recommendations in this book are controversial. You will probably not agree with all of them. You might violently disagree with some of them. That’s fine. We can’t claim final authority. On the other hand, the recommendations in this book are things that we have thought long and hard about. We have learned them through decades of experience and repeated trial and error. So whether you agree or disagree, it would be a shame if you did not see, and respect, our point of view.

> 实际上，书中很多建议都存在争议。或许你并不完全同意这些建议。你可能会强烈反对其中一些建议。这样挺好的。我们不能要求做最终权威。另外一方面，书中列出的建议，乃是我们长久苦思、从数十年的从业经验和无数尝试与错误中得来。无论你同意与否，如果你没看到或是不尊敬我们的观点，就真该自己害臊。
