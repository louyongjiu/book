## 1.5 我们是作者

The @author field of a Javadoc tells us who we are. We are authors. And one thing about authors is that they have readers. Indeed, authors are responsible for communicating well with their readers. The next time you write a line of code, remember you are an author, writing for readers who will judge your effort.

> Javadoc 中的@author 字段告诉我们自己是什么人。我们是作者。作者都有读者。实际上，作者有责任与读者做良好沟通。下次你写代码的时候，记得自己是作者，要为评判你工作的读者写代码。

You might ask: How much is code really read? Doesn’t most of the effort go into writing it?

> 你或许会问：代码真正“读”的成分有多少呢？难道力量主要不是用在“写”上吗？

Have you ever played back an edit session? In the 80s and 90s we had editors like Emacs that kept track of every keystroke. You could work for an hour and then play back your whole edit session like a high-speed movie. When I did this, the results were fascinating.

> 你是否玩过“编辑器回放”？20 世纪 80、90 年代，Emac 之类编辑器记录每次击键动作。你可以在一小时工作之后，回放击键过程，就像是看一部高速电影。我这么做过，结果很有趣。

- The vast majority of the playback was scrolling and navigating to other modules!
- Bob enters the module.
- He scrolls down to the function needing change.
- He pauses, considering his options.
- Oh, he’s scrolling up to the top of the module to check the initialization of a variable.
- Now he scrolls back down and begins to type.
- Ooops, he’s erasing what he typed!
- He types it again.
- He erases it again!
- He types half of something else but then erases that!
- He scrolls down to another function that calls the function he’s changing to see how it is called.
- He scrolls back up and types the same code he just erased.
- He pauses.
- He erases that code again!
- He pops up another window and looks at a subclass. Is that function overridden?
- …

> - 回放过程显示，多数时间都是在滚动屏幕、浏览其他模块！
> - 鲍勃进入模块。
> - 他向下滚动到要修改的函数。
> - 他停下来考虑可以做什么。
> - 哦，他滚动到模块顶端，检查变量初始化。
> - 现在他回到修改处，开始键入。
> - 喔，他删掉了键入的内容。
> - 他重新键入。
> - 他又删除了！
> - 他键入了一半什么东西，又删除掉。
> - 他滚动到调用要修改函数的另一函数，看看是怎么调用的。
> - 他回到修改处，重新键入刚才删掉的代码。
> - 他停下来。
> - 他再一次删掉代码！
> - 他打开另一个窗口，查看别的子类。那是个复载函数吗？
> - ……

You get the drift. Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading vs. writing is well over 10:1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code.

> 你该明白了。读与写花费时间的比例超过 10:1。写新代码时，我们一直在读旧代码。

Because this ratio is so high, we want the reading of code to be easy, even if it makes the writing harder. Of course there’s no way to write code without reading it, so making it easy to read actually makes it easier to write.

> 既然比例如此之高，我们就想让读的过程变得轻松，即便那会使得编写过程更难。没可能光写不读，所以使之易读实际也使之易写。

There is no escape from this logic. You cannot write code if you cannot read the surrounding code. The code you are trying to write today will be hard or easy to write depending on how hard or easy the surrounding code is to read. So if you want to go fast, if you want to get done quickly, if you want your code to be easy to write, make it easy to read.

> 这事概无例外。不读周边代码的话就没法写代码。编写代码的难度，取决于读周边代码的难度。要想干得快，要想早点做完，要想轻松写代码，先让代码易读吧。
