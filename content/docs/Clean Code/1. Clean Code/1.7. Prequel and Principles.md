## 1.7 前传与原则

In many ways this book is a “prequel” to a book I wrote in 2002 entitled Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices (PPP). The PPP book concerns itself with the principles of object-oriented design, and many of the practices used by professional developers. If you have not read PPP, then you may find that it continues the story told by this book. If you have already read it, then you’ll find many of the sentiments of that book echoed in this one at the level of code.

> 从许多角度看，本书都是我 2002 年写那本 Agile SoftwareDevelopment：Principles，Patterns，and Practices（中译版《敏捷软件开发：原则、模式与实践》，简称 PPP）的“前传”。PPP 关注面向对象设计的原则，以及专业开发者采用的许多实践方法。假如你没读过 PPP，你会发现它像这本书的延续。如果你读过，会发现那本书的主张在代码层面于本书中回响。

In this book you will find sporadic references to various principles of design. These include the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), the Open Closed Principle (OCP), and the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) among others. These principles are described in depth in PPP.

> 在本书中，你会发现对不同设计原则的引用，包括单一权责原则（Single Responsibility Principle，SRP）、开放闭合原则（Open Closed Principle，OCP）和依赖倒置原则（Dependency Inversion Principle，DIP）等。
