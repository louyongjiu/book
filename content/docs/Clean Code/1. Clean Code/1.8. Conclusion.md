## 1.8 小结

Books on art don’t promise to make you an artist. All they can do is give you some of the tools, techniques, and thought processes that other artists have used. So too this book cannot promise to make you a good programmer. It cannot promise to give you “code-sense.” All it can do is show you the thought processes of good programmers and the tricks, techniques, and tools that they use.

> 艺术书并不保证你读过之后能成为艺术家，只能告诉你其他艺术家用过的工具、技术和思维过程。本书同样也不担保让你成为好程序员。它不担保能给你“代码感”。它所能做的，只是展示好程序员的思维过程，还有他们使用的技巧、技术和工具。

Just like a book on art, this book will be full of details. There will be lots of code. You’ll see good code and you’ll see bad code. You’ll see bad code transformed into good code. You’ll see lists of heuristics, disciplines, and techniques. You’ll see example after example. After that, it’s up to you.

> 和艺术书一样，本书也充满了细节。代码会很多。你会看到好代码，也会看到糟糕的代码。你会看到糟糕的代码如何转化为好代码。你会看到启发、规条和技巧的列表。你会看到一个又一个例子。但最终结果取决于你自己。

Remember the old joke about the concert violinist who got lost on his way to a performance? He stopped an old man on the corner and asked him how to get to Carnegie Hall. The old man looked at the violinist and the violin tucked under his arm, and said: “Practice, son. Practice!”

> 还记得那个关于小提琴家在去表演的路上迷路的老笑话吗？他在街角拦住一位长者，问他怎么才能去卡耐基音乐厅（Carnegie Hall）。长者看了看小提琴家，又看了看他手中的琴，说道：“你还得练，孩子，还得练！”
