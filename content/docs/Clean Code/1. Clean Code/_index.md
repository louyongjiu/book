> 阅读本书有两种原因：第一，你是个程序员；第二，你想成为更好的程序员。很好。我们需要更好的程序员。

This is a book about good programming. It is filled with code. We are going to look at code from every different direction. We’ll look down at it from the top, up at it from the bottom, and through it from the inside out. By the time we are done, we’re going to know a lot about code. What’s more, we’ll be able to tell the difference between good code and bad code. We’ll know how to write good code. And we’ll know how to transform bad code into good code.
