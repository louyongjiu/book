## 11.1 如何建造一个城市

Could you manage all the details yourself? Probably not. Even managing an existing city is too much for one person. Yet, cities work (most of the time). They work because cities have teams of people who manage particular parts of the city, the water systems, power systems, traffic, law enforcement, building codes, and so forth. Some of those people are responsible for the big picture, while others focus on the details.

> 你能自己掌管一切细节吗？大概不行。即便是管理一个既存的城市，也是一个人无法做到的。不过，城市还是在运转（多数时候）。因为每个城市都有一组组人管理不同的部分，供水系统、供电系统、交通、执法、立法，诸如此类。有些人负责全局，其他人负责细节。

Cities also work because they have evolved appropriate levels of abstraction and modularity that make it possible for individuals and the “components” they manage to work effectively, even without understanding the big picture.

> 城市能运转，还因为它演化出恰当的抽象等级和模块，好让个人和他们所管理的“组件”即便在不了解全局时也能有效地运转。

Although software teams are often organized like that too, the systems they work on often don’t have the same separation of concerns and levels of abstraction. Clean code helps us achieve this at the lower levels of abstraction. In this chapter let us consider how to stay clean at higher levels of abstraction, the system level.

> 尽管软件团队往往也是这样组织起来，但他们所致力的工作却常常没有同样的关注面切分及抽象层级。整洁的代码帮助我们在较低层的抽象层级上达成这一目标。本章将讨论如何在较高的抽象层级——系统层级——上保持整洁。
