## 11.7 测试驱动系统架构

The power of separating concerns through aspect-like approaches can’t be overstated. If you can write your application’s domain logic using POJOs, decoupled from any architecture concerns at the code level, then it is possible to truly test drive your architecture. You can evolve it from simple to sophisticated, as needed, by adopting new technologies on demand. It is not necessary to do a Big Design Up Front18 (BDUF). In fact, BDUF is even harmful because it inhibits adapting to change, due to the psychological resistance to discarding prior effort and because of the way architecture choices influence subsequent thinking about the design.

> 通过方面式的手段切分关注面的威力不可低估。假使你能用 POJO 编写应用程序的领域逻辑，在代码层面与架构关注面分离开，就有可能真正地用测试来驱动架构。采用一些新技术，就能将架构按需从简单演化到精细。没必要先做大设计（Big Design Up Front，BDUF）。实际上，BDUF 甚至是有害的，它阻碍改进，因为心理上会抵制丢弃既成之事，也因为架构上的方案选择影响到后续的设计思路。

Building architects have to do BDUF because it is not feasible to make radical architectural changes to a large physical structure once construction is well underway.19 Although software has its own physics,20 it is economically feasible to make radical change, if the structure of the software separates its concerns effectively.

> 建筑设计师不得不做 BDUF，因为一旦建造过程开始，就不可能对大型物理建筑的结构做根本性改动。尽管软件也有物理的一面，只要软件的构架有效切分了各个关注面，还是有可能做根本性改动的。

This means we can start a software project with a “naively simple” but nicely decoupled architecture, delivering working user stories quickly, then adding more infrastructure as we scale up. Some of the world’s largest Web sites have achieved very high availability and performance, using sophisticated data caching, security, virtualization, and so forth, all done efficiently and flexibly because the minimally coupled designs are appropriately simple at each level of abstraction and scope.

> 这意味着我们可以从“简单自然”但切分良好的架构开始做软件项目，快速交付可工作的用户故事，随着规模的增长添加更多基础架构。有些世界上最大的网站采用了精密的数据缓存、安全、虚拟化等技术，获得了极高的可用性和性能，在每个抽象层和范围之内，那些最小化耦合的设计都简单到位，效率和灵活性也随之而来。

Of course, this does not mean that we go into a project “rudderless.” We have some expectations of the general scope, goals, and schedule for the project, as well as the general structure of the resulting system. However, we must maintain the ability to change course in response to evolving circumstances.

> 当然，这不是说要毫无准备地进入一个项目。对于总的覆盖范围、目标、项目进度和最终系统的总体构架，我们会有所预期。不过，我们必须有能力随机应变。

The early EJB architecture is but one of many well-known APIs that are over-engineered and that compromise separation of concerns. Even well-designed APIs can be overkill when they aren’t really needed. A good API should largely disappear from view most of the time, so the team expends the majority of its creative efforts focused on the user stories being implemented. If not, then the architectural constraints will inhibit the efficient delivery of optimal value to the customer.

> EJB 早期架构就是一种著名的过度工程化而没能有效切分关注面的 API。在没能真正得到使用时，设计得再好的 API 也等于是杀鸡用牛刀。优秀的 API 在大多数时间都该在视线之外，这样团队才能将创造力集中在要实现的用户故事上。否则，架构上的约束就会妨碍向客户交付优化价值的软件。

To recap this long discussion, An optimal system architecture consists of modularized domains of concern, each of which is implemented with Plain Old Java (or other) Objects. The different domains are integrated together with minimally invasive Aspects or Aspect-like tools. This architecture can be test-driven, just like the code.

> 概言之，最佳的系统架构由模块化的关注面领域组成，每个关注面均用纯 Java（或其他语言）对象实现。不同的领域之间用最不具有侵害性的方面或类方面工具整合起来。这种架构能测试驱动，就像代码一样。
