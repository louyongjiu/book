## 11.8 优化决策

Modularity and separation of concerns make decentralized management and decision making possible. In a sufficiently large system, whether it is a city or a software project, no one person can make all the decisions.

> 模块化和关注面切分成就了分散化管理和决策。在巨大的系统中，不管是一座城市或一个软件项目，无人能做所有决策。

We all know it is best to give responsibilities to the most qualified persons. We often forget that it is also best to postpone decisions until the last possible moment. This isn’t lazy or irresponsible; it lets us make informed choices with the best possible information. A premature decision is a decision made with suboptimal knowledge. We will have that much less customer feedback, mental reflection on the project, and experience with our implementation choices if we decide too soon.

> 众所周知，最好是授权给最有资格的人。但我们常常忘记了，延迟决策至最后一刻也是好手段。这不是懒惰或不负责；它让我们能够基于最有可能的信息做出选择。提前决策是一种预备知识不足的决策。如果决策太早，就会缺少太多客户反馈、关于项目的思考和实施经验。

The agility provided by a POJO system with modularized concerns allows us to make optimal, just-in-time decisions, based on the most recent knowledge. The complexity of these decisions is also reduced.
