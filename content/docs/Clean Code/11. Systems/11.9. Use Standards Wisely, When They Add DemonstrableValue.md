## 11.9 明智使用添加了可论证价值的标准

Building construction is a marvel to watch because of the pace at which new buildings are built (even in the dead of winter) and because of the extraordinary designs that are possible with today’s technology. Construction is a mature industry with highly optimized parts, methods, and standards that have evolved under pressure for centuries.

> 建筑构造大有可观，既因为新建筑的构建过程（即便是在隆冬季节），也因为那些现今科技所能实现的超凡设计。建筑业是一个成熟行业，有着高度优化的部件、方法和久经岁月历练的标准。

Many teams used the EJB2 architecture because it was a standard, even when lighter-weight and more straightforward designs would have been sufficient. I have seen teams become obsessed with various strongly hyped standards and lose focus on implementing value for their customers.

> 即便是轻量级和更直截了当的设计已足敷使用，许多团队还是采用了 EJB2 架构，只因为 EJB2 是个标准。我见过一些团队，纠缠于这个或那个名声大噪的标准，却丧失了对为客户实现价值的关注。有了标准，就更易复用想法和组件、雇用拥有相关经验的人才、封装好点子，以及将组件连接起来。不过，创立标准的过程有时却漫长到行业等不及的程度，有些标准没能与它要服务的采用者的真实需求相结合。

Standards make it easier to reuse ideas and components, recruit people with relevant experience, encapsulate good ideas, and wire components together. However, the process of creating standards can sometimes take too long for industry to wait, and some standards lose touch with the real needs of the adopters they are intended to serve.
