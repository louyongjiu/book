## 2.12 每个概念对应一个词

Pick one word for one abstract concept and stick with it. For instance, it’s confusing to have fetch, retrieve, and get as equivalent methods of different classes. How do you remember which method name goes with which class? Sadly, you often have to remember which company, group, or individual wrote the library or class in order to remember which term was used. Otherwise, you spend an awful lot of time browsing through headers and previous code samples.

> 给每个抽象概念选一个词，并且一以贯之。例如，使用 fetch、 retrieve 和 get 来给在多个类中的同种方法命名。你怎么记得住哪个类中是哪个方法呢？很悲哀，你总得记住编写库或类的公司、机构或个人，才能想得起来用的是哪个术语。否则，就得耗费大把时间浏览各个文件头及前面的代码。

Modern editing environments like Eclipse and IntelliJ provide context-sensitive clues, such as the list of methods you can call on a given object. But note that the list doesn’t usually give you the comments you wrote around your function names and parameter lists. You are lucky if it gives the parameter names from function declarations. The function names have to stand alone, and they have to be consistent in order for you to pick the correct method without any additional exploration.

> Eclipse 和 IntelliJ 之类现代编程环境提供了与环境相关的线索，比如某个对象能调用的方法列表。不过要注意，列表中通常不会给出你为函数名和参数列表编写的注释。如果参数名称来自函数声明，你就太幸运了。函数名称应当独一无二，而且要保持一致，这样你才能不借助多余的浏览就找到正确的方法。

Likewise, it’s confusing to have a controller and a manager and a driver in the same code base. What is the essential difference between a DeviceManager and a Protocol-Controller? Why are both not controllers or both not managers? Are they both Drivers really? The name leads you to expect two objects that have very different type as well as having different classes.

> 同样，在同一堆代码中有 controller，又有 manager，还有 driver，就会令人困惑。DeviceManager 和 Protocol-Controller 之间有何根本区别？为什么不全用 controllers 或 managers？他们都是 Drivers 吗？这种名称，让人觉得这两个对象是不同类型的，也分属不同的类。

A consistent lexicon is a great boon to the programmers who must use your code.

> 对于那些会用到你代码的程序员，一以贯之的命名法简直就是天降福音。
