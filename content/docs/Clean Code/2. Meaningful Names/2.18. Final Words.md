## 2.18 最后的话

The hardest thing about choosing good names is that it requires good descriptive skills and a shared cultural background. This is a teaching issue rather than a technical, business, or management issue. As a result many people in this field don’t learn to do it very well.

> 取好名字最难的地方在于需要良好的描述技巧和共有文化背景。与其说这是一种技术、商业或管理问题，还不如说是一种教学问题。其结果是，这个领域内的许多人都没能学会做得很好。

People are also afraid of renaming things for fear that some other developers will object. We do not share that fear and find that we are actually grateful when names change (for the better). Most of the time we don’t really memorize the names of classes and methods. We use the modern tools to deal with details like that so we can focus on whether the code reads like paragraphs and sentences, or at least like tables and data structure (a sentence isn’t always the best way to display data). You will probably end up surprising someone when you rename, just like you might with any other code improvement. Don’t let it stop you in your tracks.

> 我们有时会怕其他开发者反对重命名。如果讨论一下就知道，如果名称改得更好，那大家真的会感激你。多数时候我们并不记忆类名和方法名。我们使用现代工具对付这些细节，好让自己集中精力于把代码写得就像词句篇章、至少像是表和数据结构（词句并非总是呈现数据的最佳手段）。改名可能会让某人吃惊，就像你做到其他代码改善工作一样。别让这种事阻碍你的前进步伐。

Follow some of these rules and see whether you don’t improve the readability of your code. If you are maintaining someone else’s code, use refactoring tools to help resolve these problems. It will pay off in the short term and continue to pay in the long run.

> 不妨试试上面这些规则，看你的代码可读性是否有所提升。如果你是在维护别人写的代码，使用重构工具来解决问题。效果立竿见影，而且会持续下去。
