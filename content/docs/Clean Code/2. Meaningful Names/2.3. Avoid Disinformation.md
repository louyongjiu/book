## 2.3 避免误导

Programmers must avoid leaving false clues that obscure the meaning of code. We should avoid words whose entrenched meanings vary from our intended meaning. For example, hp, aix, and sco would be poor variable names because they are the names of Unix platforms or variants. Even if you are coding a hypotenuse and hp looks like a good abbreviation, it could be disinformative.

> 程序员必须避免留下掩藏代码本意的错误线索。应当避免使用与本意相悖的词。例如，hp、aix 和 sco 都不该用做变量名，因为它们都是 UNIX 平台或类 UNIX 平台的专有名称。即便你是在编写三角计算程序， hp 看起来是个不错的缩写，但那也可能会提供错误信息。

Do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an accountList unless it’s actually a List. The word list means something specific to programmers. If the container holding the accounts is not actually a List, it may lead to false conclusions.1 So accountGroup or bunchOfAccounts or just plain accounts would be better.

> 别用 accountList 来指称一组账号，除非它真的是 List 类型。List 一词对程序员有特殊意义。如果包纳账号的容器并非真是个 List，就会引起错误的判断。所以，用 accountGroup 或 bunchOfAccounts，甚至直接用 accounts 都会好一些。

Beware of using names which vary in small ways. How long does it take to spot the subtle difference between a XYZControllerForEfficientHandlingOfStrings in one module and, somewhere a little more distant, XYZControllerForEfficientStorageOfStrings? The words have frightfully similar shapes.

> 提防使用不同之处较小的名称。想区分模块中某处的 XYZControllerFor EfficientHandlingOfStrings 和另一处的 XYZControllerForEfficientStorageOfStrings，会花多长时间呢？这两个词外形实在太相似了。

Spelling similar concepts similarly is information. Using inconsistent spellings is disinformation. With modern Java environments we enjoy automatic code completion. We write a few characters of a name and press some hotkey combination (if that) and are rewarded with a list of possible completions for that name. It is very helpful if names for very similar things sort together alphabetically and if the differences are very obvious, because the developer is likely to pick an object by name without seeing your copious comments or even the list of methods supplied by that class.

> 以同样的方式拼写出同样的概念才是信息。拼写前后不一致就是误导。我们很享受现代 Java 编程环境的自动代码完成特性。键入某个名称的前几个字母，按一下某个热键组合（如果有的话），就能得到一列该名称的可能形式。假如相似的名称依字母顺序放在一起，且差异很明显，那就会相当有助益，因为程序员多半会压根不看你的详细注释，甚至不看该类的方法列表就直接看名字挑一个对象。

A truly awful example of disinformative names would be the use of lower-case L or uppercase O as variable names, especially in combination. The problem, of course, is that they look almost entirely like the constants one and zero, respectively.

> 误导性名称真正可怕的例子，是用小写字母 l 和大写字母 O 作为变量名，尤其是在组合使用的时候。当然，问题在于它们看起来完全像是常量“壹”和“零”。

```java
int a = l;
if (O == l)
    a = O1;
else
    l = 01;
```

The reader may think this a contrivance, but we have examined code where such things were abundant. In one case the author of the code suggested using a different font so that the differences were more obvious, a solution that would have to be passed down to all future developers as oral tradition or in a written document. The problem is conquered with finality and without creating new work products by a simple renaming.

> 读者可能会认为这纯属虚构，但我们确曾见过充斥这类玩意的代码。有一次，代码作者建议用不同字体写变量名，好显得更清楚些，不过这种方案得要通过口头和书面传递给未来所有的开发者才行。后来，只是做了简单的重命名操作，就解决了问题，而且也没搞出别的事。
