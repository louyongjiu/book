## 2.5 使用读得出来的名称

Humans are good at words. A significant part of our brains is dedicated to the concept of words. And words are, by definition, pronounceable. It would be a shame not to take advantage of that huge portion of our brains that has evolved to deal with spoken language. So make your names pronounceable.

> 人类长于记忆和使用单词。大脑的相当一部分就是用来容纳和处理单词的。单词能读得出来。人类进化到大脑中有那么大的一块地方用来处理言语，若不善加利用，实在是种耻辱。

If you can’t pronounce it, you can’t discuss it without sounding like an idiot. “Well, over here on the bee cee arr three cee enn tee we have a pee ess zee kyew int, see?” This matters because programming is a social activity.

> 如果名称读不出来，讨论的时候就会像个傻鸟。“哎，这儿，鼻涕阿三喜摁踢（bee cee arr three cee enn tee）上头，有个皮挨死极翘（pee ess zee kyew）整数，看见没？”这不是小事，因为编程本就是一种社会活动。

A company I know has genymdhms (generation date, year, month, day, hour, minute, and second) so they walked around saying “gen why emm dee aich emm ess”. I have an annoying habit of pronouncing everything as written, so I started saying “gen-yah-muddahims.” It later was being called this by a host of designers and analysts, and we still sounded silly. But we were in on the joke, so it was fun. Fun or not, we were tolerating poor naming. New developers had to have the variables explained to them, and then they spoke about it in silly made-up words instead of using proper English terms. Compare

> 有家公司，程序里面写了个 genymdhms（生成日期，年、月、日、时、分、秒），他们一般读作“gen why emm dee aich emm ess”。我有个见字照读的恶习，于是开口就念“gen-yah-mudda-hims”。后来好些设计师和分析师都有样学样，听起来傻乎乎的。我们知道典故，所以会觉得很搞笑。搞笑归搞笑，实际是在强忍糟糕的命名。在给新开发者解释变量的意义时，他们总是读出傻乎乎的自造词，而非恰当的英语词。比较

```java
class DtaRcrd102 {
    private Date genymdhms;
    private Date modymdhms;
    private final String pszqint = "102";
    /* … */
};
```

to

> 和

```java
class Customer {
    private Date generationTimestamp;
    private Date modificationTimestamp;
    private final String recordId = "102";
    /* … */
}
```

Intelligent conversation is now possible: “Hey, Mikey, take a look at this record! The generation timestamp is set to tomorrow’s date! How can that be?”

现在读起来就像人话了：“喂，Mikey，看看这条记录！生成时间戳（generation timestamp）被设置为明天了！不能这样吧？”
