## 2.6 使用可搜索的名称

Single-letter names and numeric constants have a particular problem in that they are not easy to locate across a body of text.

> 单字母名称和数字常量有个问题，就是很难在一大篇文字中找出来。

One might easily grep for MAX_CLASSES_PER_STUDENT, but the number 7 could be more troublesome. Searches may turn up the digit as part of file names, other constant definitions, and in various expressions where the value is used with different intent. It is even worse when a constant is a long number and someone might have transposed digits, thereby creating a bug while simultaneously evading the programmer’s search.

> 找 MAX_CLASSES_PER_STUDENT 很容易，但想找数字 7 就麻烦了，它可能是某些文件名或其他常量定义的一部分，出现在因不同意图而采用的各种表达式中。如果该常量是个长数字，又被人错改过，就会逃过搜索，从而造成错误。

Likewise, the name e is a poor choice for any variable for which a programmer might need to search. It is the most common letter in the English language and likely to show up in every passage of text in every program. In this regard, longer names trump shorter names, and any searchable name trumps a constant in code.

> 同样，e 也不是个便于搜索的好变量名。它是英文中最常用的字母，在每个程序、每段代码中都有可能出现。由此而见，长名称胜于短名称，搜得到的名称胜于用自造编码代写就的名称。

My personal preference is that single-letter names can ONLY be used as local variables inside short methods. The length of a name should correspond to the size of its scope [N5]. If a variable or constant might be seen or used in multiple places in a body of code, it is imperative to give it a search-friendly name. Once again compare

> 窃以为单字母名称仅用于短方法中的本地变量。名称长短应与其作用域大小相对应[N5]。若变量或常量可能在代码中多处使用，则应赋其以便于搜索的名称。再比较

```java
for (int j=0; j<34; j++) {
  s += (t[j]*4)/5;
}
```

```cpp
int realDaysPerIdealDay = 4;
const int WORK_DAYS_PER_WEEK = 5;
int sum = 0;
for (int j=0; j < NUMBER_OF_TASKS; j++) {
  int realTaskDays = taskEstimate[j] * realDaysPerIdealDay;
  int realTaskWeeks = (realdays / WORK_DAYS_PER_WEEK);
  sum += realTaskWeeks;
}
```

Note that sum, above, is not a particularly useful name but at least is searchable. The intentionally named code makes for a longer function, but consider how much easier it will be to find WORK_DAYS_PER_WEEK than to find all the places where 5 was used and filter the list down to just the instances with the intended meaning.

> 注意，上面代码中的 sum 并非特别有用的名称，不过它至少搜得到。采用能表达意图的名称，貌似拉长了函数代码，但要想想看，WORK_DAYS_PER_WEEK 要比数字 5 好找得多，而列表中也只剩下了体现作者意图的名称。
