## 2.8 避免思维映射

Readers shouldn’t have to mentally translate your names into other names they already know. This problem generally arises from a choice to use neither problem domain terms nor solution domain terms.

> 不应当让读者在脑中把你的名称翻译为他们熟知的名称。这种问题经常出现在选择是使用问题领域术语还是解决方案领域术语时。

This is a problem with single-letter variable names. Certainly a loop counter may be named i or j or k (though never l!) if its scope is very small and no other names can conflict with it. This is because those single-letter names for loop counters are traditional. However, in most other contexts a single-letter name is a poor choice; it’s just a place holder that the reader must mentally map to the actual concept. There can be no worse reason for using the name c than because a and b were already taken.

> 单字母变量名就是个问题。在作用域较小、也没有名称冲突时，循环计数器自然有可能被命名为 i 或 j 或 k。（但千万别用字母 l！）这是因为传统上惯用单字母名称做循环计数器。然而，在多数其他情况下，单字母名称不是个好选择；读者必须在脑中将它映射为真实概念。仅仅是因为有了 a 和 b，就要取名为 c，实在并非像样的理由。

In general programmers are pretty smart people. Smart people sometimes like to show off their smarts by demonstrating their mental juggling abilities. After all, if you can reliably remember that r is the lower-cased version of the url with the host and scheme removed, then you must clearly be very smart.

> 程序员通常都是聪明人。聪明人有时会借脑筋急转弯炫耀其聪明。总而言之，假使你记得 r 代表不包含主机名和图式（scheme）的小写字母版 url 的话，那你真是太聪明了。

One difference between a smart programmer and a professional programmer is that the professional understands that clarity is king. Professionals use their powers for good and write code that others can understand.

> 聪明程序员和专业程序员之间的区别在于，专业程序员了解，明确是王道。专业程序员善用其能，编写其他人能理解的代码。
