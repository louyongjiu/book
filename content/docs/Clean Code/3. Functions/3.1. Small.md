## 3.1 短小

The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that. This is not an assertion that I can justify. I can’t provide any references to research that shows that very small functions are better. What I can tell you is that for nearly four decades I have written functions of all different sizes. I’ve written several nasty 3,000-line abominations. I’ve written scads of functions in the 100 to 300 line range. And I’ve written functions that were 20 to 30 lines long. What this experience has taught me, through long trial and error, is that functions should be very small.

> 函数的第一规则是要短小。第二条规则是还要更短小。我无法证明这个断言。我给不出任何证实了小函数更好的研究结果。我能说的是，近 40 年来，我写过各种不同大小的函数。我写过令人憎恶的长达 3000 行的厌物，也写过许多 100 行到 300 行的函数，我还写过 20 行到 30 行的。经过漫长的试错，经验告诉我，函数就该小。

In the eighties we used to say that a function should be no bigger than a screen-full. Of course we said that at a time when VT100 screens were 24 lines by 80 columns, and our editors used 4 lines for administrative purposes. Nowadays with a cranked-down font and a nice big monitor, you can fit 150 characters on a line and a 100 lines or more on a screen. Lines should not be 150 characters long. Functions should not be 100 lines long. Functions should hardly ever be 20 lines long.

> 在 20 世纪 80 年代，我们常说函数不该长于一屏。当然，说这话的时候，VT100 屏幕只有 24 行、80 列，而编辑器就得先占去 4 行空间放菜单。如今，用上了精致的字体和宽大的显示器，一屏里面可以显示 100 行，每行能容纳 150 个字符。每行都不应该有 150 个字符那么长。函数也不该有 100 行那么长，20 行封顶最佳。

How short should a function be? In 1999 I went to visit Kent Beck at his home in Oregon. We sat down and did some programming together. At one point he showed me a cute little Java/Swing program that he called Sparkle. It produced a visual effect on the screen very similar to the magic wand of the fairy godmother in the movie Cinderella. As you moved the mouse, the sparkles would drip from the cursor with a satisfying scintillation, falling to the bottom of the window through a simulated gravitational field. When Kent showed me the code, I was struck by how small all the functions were. I was used to functions in Swing programs that took up miles of vertical space. Every function in this program was just two, or three, or four lines long. Each was transparently obvious. Each told a story. And each led you to the next in a compelling order. That’s how short your functions should be!3

> 函数到底该有多长？1991 年，我去 Kent Beck 位于奥勒冈州（Oregon）的家中拜访。我们坐到一起写了些代码。他给我看一个叫做 Sparkle（火花闪耀）的有趣的 Java/Swing 小程序。程序在屏幕上描画电影 Cinderella（《灰姑娘》）中仙女用魔棒造出的那种视觉效果。只要移动鼠标，光标所在处就会爆发出一团令人欣喜的火花，沿着模拟重力场划落到窗口底部。肯特给我看代码的时候，我惊讶于其中那些函数尺寸之小。我看惯了 Swing 程序中长度数以里计的函数。但这个程序中每个函数都只有两行、三行或四行长。每个函数都一目了然。每个函数都只说一件事。而且，每个函数都依序把你带到下一个函数。这就是函数应该达到的短小程度！

How short should your functions be? They should usually be shorter than Listing 3-2! Indeed, Listing 3-2 should really be shortened to Listing 3-3.

> 函数应该有多短小？通常来说，应该短于代码清单 3-2 中的函数！代码清单 3-2 实在应该缩短成代码清单 3-3 这个样子。

Listing 3-3 HtmlUtil.java (re-refactored)

> 代码清单 3-3 HtmlUtil.java（再次重构之后）

```java
public static String renderPageWith;

SetupsAndTeardowns(
        PageData pageData, boolean isSuite) throws Exception {
    if (isTestPage(pageData))
        includeSetupAndTeardownPages(pageData, isSuite);
    return pageData.getHtml();
}
```

### Blocks and Indenting 代码块和缩进

This implies that the blocks within if statements, else statements, while statements, and so on should be one line long. Probably that line should be a function call. Not only does this keep the enclosing function small, but it also adds documentary value because the function called within the block can have a nicely descriptive name.

> if 语句、else 语句、while 语句等，其中的代码块应该只有一行。该行大抵应该是一个函数调用语句。这样不但能保持函数短小，而且，因为块内调用的函数拥有较具说明性的名称，从而增加了文档上的价值。

This also implies that functions should not be large enough to hold nested structures. Therefore, the indent level of a function should not be greater than one or two. This, of course, makes the functions easier to read and understand.

> 这也意味着函数不应该大到足以容纳嵌套结构。所以，函数的缩进层级不该多于一层或两层。当然，这样的函数易于阅读和理解。
