## 3.13 小结

Every system is built from a domain-specific language designed by the programmers to describe that system. Functions are the verbs of that language, and classes are the nouns. This is not some throwback to the hideous old notion that the nouns and verbs in a requirements document are the first guess of the classes and functions of a system. Rather, this is a much older truth. The art of programming is, and has always been, the art of language design.

> 每个系统都是使用某种领域特定语言搭建，而这种语言是程序员设计来描述那个系统的。函数是语言的动词，类是名词。这并非是退回到那种认为需求文档中的名词和动词就是系统中类和函数的最初设想的可怕的旧观念。其实这是个历史更久的真理。编程艺术是且一直就是语言设计的艺术。

Master programmers think of systems as stories to be told rather than programs to be written. They use the facilities of their chosen programming language to construct a much richer and more expressive language that can be used to tell that story. Part of that domain-specific language is the hierarchy of functions that describe all the actions that take place within that system. In an artful act of recursion those actions are written to use the very domain-specific language they define to tell their own small part of the story.

> 大师级程序员把系统当作故事来讲，而不是当作程序来写。他们使用选定编程语言提供的工具构建一种更为丰富且更具表达力的语言，用来讲那个故事。那种领域特定语言的一个部分，就是描述在系统中发生的各种行为的函数层级。在一种狡猾的递归操作中，这些行为使用它们定义的与领域紧密相关的语言讲述自己那个小故事。

This chapter has been about the mechanics of writing functions well. If you follow the rules herein, your functions will be short, well named, and nicely organized. But never forget that your real goal is to tell the story of the system, and that the functions you write need to fit cleanly together into a clear and precise language to help you with that telling.

> 本章所讲述的是有关编写良好函数的机制。如果你遵循这些规则，函数就会短小，有个好名字，而且被很好地归置。不过永远别忘记，真正的目标在于讲述系统的故事，而你编写的函数必须干净利落地拼装到一起，形成一种精确而清晰的语言，帮助你讲故事。
