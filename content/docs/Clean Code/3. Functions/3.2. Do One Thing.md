## 3.2 只做一件事

It should be very clear that Listing 3-1 is doing lots more than one thing. It’s creating buffers, fetching pages, searching for inherited pages, rendering paths, appending arcane strings, and generating HTML, among other things. Listing 3-1 is very busy doing lots of different things. On the other hand, Listing 3-3 is doing one simple thing. It’s including setups and teardowns into test pages.

> 代码清单 3-1 显然想做好几件事。它创建缓冲区、获取页面、搜索继承下来的页面、渲染路径、添加神秘的字符串、生成 HTML，如此等等。代码清单 3-1 手忙脚乱。而代码清单 3-3 则只做一件简单的事。它将设置和拆解包纳到测试页面中。

The following advice has appeared in one form or another for 30 years or more.

FUNCTIONS SHOULD DO ONE THING. THEY SHOULD DO IT WELL. THEY SHOULD DO IT ONLY.

> 函数应该做一件事。做好这件事。只做这一件事。

The problem with this statement is that it is hard to know what “one thing” is. Does Listing 3-3 do one thing? It’s easy to make the case that it’s doing three things:

> 问题在于很难知道那件该做的事是什么。代码清单 3-3 只做了一件事，对吧？其实也很容易看作是三件事：

1. Determining whether the page is a test page.
2. If so, including setups and teardowns.
3. Rendering the page in HTML.

> 1. 判断是否为测试页面；
> 2. 如果是，则容纳进设置和分拆步骤；
> 3. 渲染成 HTML。

So which is it? Is the function doing one thing or three things? Notice that the three steps of the function are one level of abstraction below the stated name of the function. We can describe the function by describing it as a brief TO4 paragraph:

> 那件事是什么？函数是做了一件事呢，还是做了三件事？注意，这三个步骤均在该函数名下的同一抽象层上。可以用简洁的 TO 起头段落来描述这个函数：

TO RenderPageWithSetupsAndTeardowns, we check to see whether the page is a test page and if so, we include the setups and teardowns. In either case we render the page in HTML.

> （要 RenderPageWithSetupsAndTeardowns，检查页面是否为测试页，如果是测试页，就容纳进设置和分拆步骤。无论是否测试页，都渲染成 HTML）

If a function does only those steps that are one level below the stated name of the function, then the function is doing one thing. After all, the reason we write functions is to decompose a larger concept (in other words, the name of the function) into a set of steps at the next level of abstraction.

> 如果函数只是做了该函数名下同一抽象层上的步骤，则函数还是只做了一件事。编写函数毕竟是为了把大一些的概念（换言之，函数的名称）拆分为另一抽象层上的一系列步骤。

It should be very clear that Listing 3-1 contains steps at many different levels of abstraction. So it is clearly doing more than one thing. Even Listing 3-2 has two levels of abstraction, as proved by our ability to shrink it down. But it would be very hard to meaningfully shrink Listing 3-3. We could extract the if statement into a function named includeSetupsAndTeardownsIfTestPage, but that simply restates the code without changing the level of abstraction.

> 代码清单 3-1 明显包括了处于多个不同抽象层级的步骤。显然，它所做的不止一件事。即便是代码清单 3-2 也有两个抽象层，这已被我们将其缩短的能力所证明。然而，很难再将代码清单 3-3 做有意义的缩短。可以将 if 语句拆出来做一个名为 includeSetupAndTeardonwsIfTestpage 的函数，但那只是重新诠释代码，并未改变抽象层级。

So, another way to know that a function is doing more than “one thing” is if you can extract another function from it with a name that is not merely a restatement of its implementation [G34].

> 所以，要判断函数是否不止做了一件事，还有一个方法，就是看是否能再拆出一个函数，该函数不仅只是单纯地重新诠释其实现[G34]。

### Sections within Functions 函数中的区段

Look at Listing 4-7 on page 71. Notice that the generatePrimes function is divided into sections such as declarations, initializations, and sieve. This is an obvious symptom of doing more than one thing. Functions that do one thing cannot be reasonably divided into sections.

> 请看代码清单 4-7。注意，generatePrimes 函数被切分为 declarations、initializations 和 sieve 等区段。这就是函数做事太多的明显征兆。只做一件事的函数无法被合理地切分为多个区段。
