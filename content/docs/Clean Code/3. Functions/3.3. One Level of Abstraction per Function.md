## 3.3 每个函数一个抽象层级

In order to make sure our functions are doing “one thing,” we need to make sure that the statements within our function are all at the same level of abstraction. It is easy to see how Listing 3-1 violates this rule. There are concepts in there that are at a very high level of abstraction, such as getHtml(); others that are at an intermediate level of abstraction, such as: String pagePathName = PathParser.render(pagePath); and still others that are remarkably low level, such as: .append(”\n”).

> 要确保函数只做一件事，函数中的语句都要在同一抽象层级上。一眼就能看出，代码清单 3-1 违反了这条规矩。那里面有 getHtml() 等位于较高抽象层的概念，也有 String pagePathName = PathParser.render(pagePath)等位于中间抽象层的概念，还有.append("\n") 等位于相当低的抽象层的概念。

Mixing levels of abstraction within a function is always confusing. Readers may not be able to tell whether a particular expression is an essential concept or a detail. Worse, like broken windows, once details are mixed with essential concepts, more and more details tend to accrete within the function.

> 函数中混杂不同抽象层级，往往让人迷惑。读者可能无法判断某个表达式是基础概念还是细节。更恶劣的是，就像破损的窗户，一旦细节与基础概念混杂，更多的细节就会在函数中纠结起来。

### Reading Code from Top to Bottom: The Stepdown Rule 自顶向下读代码：向下规则

We want the code to read like a top-down narrative.5 We want every function to be followed by those at the next level of abstraction so that we can read the program, descending one level of abstraction at a time as we read down the list of functions. I call this The Step-down Rule.

> 我们想要让代码拥有自顶向下的阅读顺序。我们想要让每个函数后面都跟着位于下一抽象层级的函数，这样一来，在查看函数列表时，就能偱抽象层级向下阅读了。我把这叫做向下规则。

To say this differently, we want to be able to read the program as though it were a set of TO paragraphs, each of which is describing the current level of abstraction and referencing subsequent TO paragraphs at the next level down.

> 换一种说法。我们想要这样读程序：程序就像是一系列 TO 起头的段落，每一段都描述当前抽象层级，并引用位于下一抽象层级的后续 TO 起头段落。

- To include the setups and teardowns, we include setups, then we include the test page content, and then we include the teardowns.
- To include the setups, we include the suite setup if this is a suite, then we include the regular setup.
- To include the suite setup, we search the parent hierarchy for the “SuiteSetUp” page and add an include statement with the path of that page.
- To search the parent…

> - （要容纳设置步骤，如果是套件，就纳入套件设置步骤，然后再纳入普通设置步骤。）
> - （要容纳套件设置步骤，先搜索“SuiteSetUp”页面的上级继承关系，再添加一个包括该页面路径的语句。）
> - （要搜索……）

It turns out to be very difficult for programmers to learn to follow this rule and write functions that stay at a single level of abstraction. But learning this trick is also very important. It is the key to keeping functions short and making sure they do “one thing.” Making the code read like a top-down set of TO paragraphs is an effective technique for keeping the abstraction level consistent.

> 程序员往往很难学会遵循这条规则，写出只停留于一个抽象层级上的函数。尽管如此，学习这个技巧还是很重要。这是保持函数短小、确保只做一件事的要诀。让代码读起来像是一系列自顶向下的 TO 起头段落是保持抽象层级协调一致的有效技巧。

Take a look at Listing 3-7 at the end of this chapter. It shows the whole testableHtml function refactored according to the principles described here. Notice how each function introduces the next, and each function remains at a consistent level of abstraction.

> 看看本章末尾的代码清单 3-7。它展示了遵循这条原则重构的完整 testableHtml 函数。留意每个函数是如何引出下一个函数，如何保持在同一抽象层上的。
