## 3.4 switch 语句

It’s hard to make a small switch statement.6 Even a switch statement with only two cases is larger than I’d like a single block or function to be. It’s also hard to make a switch statement that does one thing. By their nature, switch statements always do N things. Unfortunately we can’t always avoid switch statements, but we can make sure that each switch statement is buried in a low-level class and is never repeated. We do this, of course, with polymorphism.

> 写出短小的 switch 语句很难。即便是只有两种条件的 switch 语句也要比我想要的单个代码块或函数大得多。写出只做一件事的 switch 语句也很难。Switch 天生要做 N 件事。不幸我们总无法避开 switch 语句，不过还是能够确保每个 switch 都埋藏在较低的抽象层级，而且永远不重复。当然，我们利用多态来实现这一点。

Consider Listing 3-4. It shows just one of the operations that might depend on the type of employee.

> 请看代码清单 3-4。它呈现了可能依赖于雇员类型的仅仅一种操作。

Listing 3-4 Payroll.java

> 代码清单 3-4 Payroll.java

```java
public Money calculatePay(Employee e)
        throws InvalidEmployeeType {
    switch (e.type) {
        case COMMISSIONED:
            return calculateCommissionedPay(e);
        case HOURLY:
            return calculateHourlyPay(e);
        case SALARIED:
            return calculateSalariedPay(e);
        default:
            throw new InvalidEmployeeType(e.type);
    }
}
```

There are several problems with this function. First, it’s large, and when new employee types are added, it will grow. Second, it very clearly does more than one thing. Third, it violates the Single Responsibility Principle7 (SRP) because there is more than one reason for it to change. Fourth, it violates the Open Closed Principle8 (OCP) because it must change whenever new types are added. But possibly the worst problem with this function is that there are an unlimited number of other functions that will have the same structure. For example we could have

> 该函数有好几个问题。首先，它太长，当出现新的雇员类型时，还会变得更长。其次，它明显做了不止一件事。第三，它违反了单一权责原则（Single Responsibility Principle, SRP），因为有好几个修改它的理由。第四，它违反了开放闭合原则（Open Closed Principle,OCP），因为每当添加新类型时，就必须修改之。不过，该函数最麻烦的可能是到处皆有类似结构的函数。例如，可能会有

```java
isPayday(Employee e, Date date),
```

or

> 或

```java
deliverPay(Employee e, Money pay),
```

or a host of others. All of which would have the same deleterious structure.

> 如此等等。它们的结构都有同样的问题。

The solution to this problem (see Listing 3-5) is to bury the switch statement in the basement of an ABSTRACT FACTORY,9 and never let anyone see it. The factory will use the switch statement to create appropriate instances of the derivatives of Employee, and the various functions, such as calculatePay, isPayday, and deliverPay, will be dispatched polymorphically through the Employee interface.

> 该问题的解决方案（如代码清单 3-5 所示）是将 switch 语句埋到抽象工厂底下，不让任何人看到。该工厂使用 switch 语句为 Employee 的派生物创建适当的实体，而不同的函数，如 calculatePay、isPayday 和 deliverPay 等，则藉由 Employee 接口多态地接受派遣。

My general rule for switch statements is that they can be tolerated if they appear only once, are used to create polymorphic objects, and are hidden behind an inheritance relationship so that the rest of the system can’t see them [G23]. Of course every circumstance is unique, and there are times when I violate one or more parts of that rule.

> 对于 switch 语句，我的规矩是如果只出现一次，用于创建多态对象，而且隐藏在某个继承关系中，在系统其他部分看不到，就还能容忍 [G23]。当然也要就事论事，有时我也会部分或全部违反这条规矩。
