## 4.1 注释不能美化糟糕的代码

One of the more common motivations for writing comments is bad code. We write a module and we know it is confusing and disorganized. We know it’s a mess. So we say to ourselves, “Ooh, I’d better comment that!” No! You’d better clean it!

> 写注释的常见动机之一是糟糕的代码的存在。我们编写一个模块，发现它令人困扰、乱七八糟。我们知道，它烂透了。我们告诉自己：“喔，最好写点注释！”不！最好是把代码弄干净！

Clear and expressive code with few comments is far superior to cluttered and complex code with lots of comments. Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you’ve made, spend it cleaning that mess.

> 带有少量注释的整洁而有表达力的代码，要比带有大量注释的零碎而复杂的代码像样得多。与其花时间编写解释你搞出的糟糕的代码的注释，不如花时间清洁那堆糟糕的代码。
