## 4.2 用代码来阐述

There are certainly times when code makes a poor vehicle for explanation. Unfortunately, many programmers have taken this to mean that code is seldom, if ever, a good means for explanation. This is patently false. Which would you rather see? This:

> 有时，代码本身不足以解释其行为。不幸的是，许多程序员据此以为代码很少——如果有的话——能做好解释工作。这种观点纯属错误。

```java
// Check to see if the employee is eligible for full benefits
if ((employee.flags & HOURLY_FLAG) &&
    (employee.age > 65))
```

Or this?

> 你愿意看到这个：

```java
if (employee.isEligibleForFullBenefits())
```

It takes only a few seconds of thought to explain most of your intent in code. In many cases it’s simply a matter of creating a function that says the same thing as the comment you want to write.

> 只要想上那么几秒钟，就能用代码解释你大部分的意图。很多时候，简单到只需要创建一个描述与注释所言同一事物的函数即可。
