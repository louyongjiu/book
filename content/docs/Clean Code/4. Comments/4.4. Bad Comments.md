## 4.4 坏注释

Most comments fall into this category. Usually they are crutches or excuses for poor code or justifications for insufficient decisions, amounting to little more than the programmer talking to himself.

> 大多数注释都属此类。通常，坏注释都是糟糕的代码的支撑或借口，或者对错误决策的修正，基本上等于程序员自说自话。

### 4.4.1 Mumbling 喃喃自语

Plopping in a comment just because you feel you should or because the process requires it, is a hack. If you decide to write a comment, then spend the time necessary to make sure it is the best comment you can write.

> 如果只是因为你觉得应该或者因为过程需要就添加注释，那就是无谓之举。如果你决定写注释，就要花必要的时间确保写出最好的注释。

Here, for example, is a case I found in FitNesse, where a comment might indeed have been useful. But the author was in a hurry or just not paying much attention. His mumbling left behind an enigma:

> 例如，我在 FitNesse 中找到的这个例子，例中的注释大概确实有用。不过，作者太着急，或者没太花心思。他的喃喃自语变成了一个谜团。

```java
public void loadProperties() {
    try {
        String propertiesPath = propertiesLocation +
                "/" + PROPERTIES_FILE;
        FileInputStream propertiesStream = new
                FileInputStream(propertiesPath);
        loadedProperties.load(propertiesStream);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // No properties files means all defaults are loaded
    }
}
```

What does that comment in the catch block mean? Clearly it meant something to the author, but the meaning does not come through all that well. Apparently, if we get an IOException, it means that there was no properties file; and in that case all the defaults are loaded. But who loads all the defaults? Were they loaded before the call to loadProperties.load? Or did loadProperties.load catch the exception, load the defaults, and then pass the exception on for us to ignore? Or did loadProperties.load load all the defaults before attempting to load the file? Was the author trying to comfort himself about the fact that he was leaving the catch block empty? Or—and this is the scary possibility—was the author trying to tell himself to come back here later and write the code that would load the defaults?

> catch 代码块中的注释是什么意思呢？显然对于作者有其意义，不过并没有好到足够的程度。很明显，如果出现 IOException，就表示没有属性文件；在那种情况下，载入默认设置。但谁来装载默认设置呢？会在对 loadProperties.load 之前装载吗？抑或 loadProperties.load 捕获异常、装载默认设置、再向上传递异常？再或 loadProperties.load 在尝试载入文件前就装载所有默认设置？要么作者只是在安慰自己别在意 catch 代码块的留空？

Our only recourse is to examine the code in other parts of the system to find out what’s going on. Any comment that forces you to look in another module for the meaning of that comment has failed to communicate to you and is not worth the bits it consumes.

> 或者——这种可能最可怕——作者是想告诉自己，将来再回头写装载默认设置的代码？我们唯有检视系统其他部分的代码，弄清事情原委。任何迫使读者查看其他模块的注释，都没能与读者沟通好，不值所费。

### 4.4.2 Redundant Comments 多余的注释

Listing 4-1 shows a simple function with a header comment that is completely redundant. The comment probably takes longer to read than the code itself.

> 代码清单 4-1 展示的简单函数，其头部位置的注释全属多余。读这段注释花的时间没准比读代码花的时间还要长。

Listing 4-1 waitForClose

> 代码清单 4-1 waitForClose

```java
// Utility method that returns when this.closed is true. Throws an exception
// if the timeout is reached.
public synchronized void waitForClose(final long timeoutMillis)
        throws Exception {
    if (!closed) {
        wait(timeoutMillis);
        if (!closed)
            throw new Exception("MockResponseSender could not be closed");
    }
}
```

What purpose does this comment serve? It’s certainly not more informative than the code. It does not justify the code, or provide intent or rationale. It is not easier to read than the code. Indeed, it is less precise than the code and entices the reader to accept that lack of precision in lieu of true understanding. It is rather like a gladhanding used-car salesman assuring you that you don’t need to look under the hood.

> 这段注释起了什么作用？它并不能比代码本身提供更多的信息。它没有证明代码的意义，也没有给出代码的意图或逻辑。读它并不比读代码更容易。事实上，它不如代码精确，误导读者接受不精确的信息，而不是正确地理解代码。它就像个自来熟的二手车贩子，满口保证你不用打开发动机盖查验。来看看代码清单 4-2 中摘自 Tomcat 项目的无用而多余的 Javadoc 吧。

Now consider the legion of useless and redundant javadocs in Listing 4-2 taken from Tomcat. These comments serve only to clutter and obscure the code. They serve no documentary purpose at all. To make matters worse, I only showed you the first few. There are many more in this module.

> 这些注释只是一味将代码搞得含糊不明。完全没有文档上的价值。下面只列出了靠前面的一些代码，后续模块中还有许多类似情况。

Listing 4-2 ContainerBase.java (Tomcat)

> 代码清单 4-2 ContainerBase.java （Tomcat）

     * is associated.
     */
    protected DirContext resources = null;
}
```

### 4.4.3 Misleading Comments 误导性注释

Sometimes, with all the best intentions, a programmer makes a statement in his comments that isn’t precise enough to be accurate. Consider for another moment the badly redundant but also subtly misleading comment we saw in Listing 4-1.

> 有时，尽管初衷可嘉，程序员还是会写出不够精确的注释。想想看代码清单 4-1 中那多余而又有误导嫌疑的注释吧。

Did you discover how the comment was misleading? The method does not return when this.closed becomes true. It returns if this.closed is true; otherwise, it waits for a blind time-out and then throws an exception if this.closed is still not true.

> 你有没有发现那样的注释是如何误导读者的？在 this.closed 变为 true 的时候，方法并没有返回。方法只在判断到 this.closed 为 true 的时候返回，否则，就只是等待遥遥无期的超时，然后如果判断 this.closed 还是非 true，就抛出一个异常。

This subtle bit of misinformation, couched in a comment that is harder to read than the body of the code, could cause another programmer to blithely call this function in the expectation that it will return as soon as this.closed becomes true. That poor programmer would then find himself in a debugging session trying to figure out why his code executed so slowly.

> 这一细微的误导信息，放在比代码本身更难阅读的注释里面，有可能导致其他程序员快活地调用这个函数，并期望在 this.closed 变为 true 时立即返回。那位可怜的程序员将会发现自己陷于调试困境之中，拼命想找出代码执行得如此之慢的原因。

### 4.4.4 Mandated Comments 循规式注释

It is just plain silly to have a rule that says that every function must have a javadoc, or every variable must have a comment. Comments like this just clutter up the code, propagate lies, and lend to general confusion and disorganization.

> 所谓每个函数都要有 Javadoc 或每个变量都要有注释的规矩全然是愚蠢可笑的。这类注释徒然让代码变得散乱，满口胡言，令人迷惑不解。

For example, required javadocs for every function lead to abominations such as Listing 4-3. This clutter adds nothing and serves only to obfuscate the code and create the potential for lies and misdirection.

> 例如，要求每个函数都要有 Javadoc，就会得到类似代码清单 4-3 那样面目可憎的代码。这类废话只会搞乱代码，有可能误导读者。

Listing 4-3

> 代码清单 4-3

```java
/**
 * @param title             The title of the CD
 * @param author            The author of the CD
 * @param tracks            The number of tracks on the CD
 * @param durationInMinutes The duration of the CD in minutes
 */
public void addCD(String title, String author,
                  int tracks, int durationInMinutes) {
    CD cd = new CD();
    cd.title = title;
    cd.author = author;
    cd.tracks = tracks;
    cd.duration = duration;
    cdList.add(cd);
}
```

### 4.4.5 Journal Comments 日志式注释

Sometimes people add a comment to the start of a module every time they edit it. These comments accumulate as a kind of journal, or log, of every change that has ever been made. I have seen some modules with dozens of pages of these run-on journal entries.

> 有人会在每次编辑代码时，在模块开始处添加一条注释。这类注释就像是一种记录每次修改的日志。我见过满篇尽是这类日志的代码模块。

```java
* Changes (from 11-Oct-2001)
* --------------------------
* 11-Oct-2001 : Re-organised the class and moved it to new package
*               com.jrefinery.date (DG);
* 05-Nov-2001 : Added a getDescription() method, and eliminated NotableDate
*               class (DG);
* 12-Nov-2001 : IBD requires setDescription() method, now that NotableDate
*               class is gone (DG);  Changed getPreviousDayOfWeek(),
*               getFollowingDayOfWeek() and getNearestDayOfWeek() to correct
*               bugs (DG);
* 05-Dec-2001 : Fixed bug in SpreadsheetDate class (DG);
* 29-May-2002 : Moved the month constants into a separate interface

* 05-Jan-2005 : Fixed bug in addYears() method (1096282) (DG);
```

Long ago there was a good reason to create and maintain these log entries at the start of every module. We didn’t have source code control systems that did it for us. Nowadays, however, these long journals are just more clutter to obfuscate the module. They should be completely removed.

> 很久以前，在模块开始处创建并维护这些记录还算有道理。那时，我们还没有源代码控制系统可用。如今，这种冗长的记录只会让模块变得凌乱不堪，应当全部删除。

### 4.4.6 Noise Comments 废话注释

Sometimes you see comments that are nothing but noise. They restate the obvious and provide no new information.

> 有时，你会看到纯然是废话的注释。它们对于显然之事喋喋不休，毫无新意。

```java
/**
 * Default constructor.
 */
protected AnnualDateRule() {
}
```

No, really? Or how about this:

> 对吧？再看看这个：

```java
/**
 * The day of the month.
 */
private int dayOfMonth;
```

And then there’s this paragon of redundancy:

> 这样的废话模范：

```java
/**
 * Returns the day of the month.
 *
 * @return the day of the month.
 */
public int getDayOfMonth() {
    return dayOfMonth;
}
```

These comments are so noisy that we learn to ignore them. As we read through code, our eyes simply skip over them. Eventually the comments begin to lie as the code around them changes.

> 这类注释废话连篇，我们都学会了视而不见。读代码时，眼光不会停留在它们上面。最终，当代码修改之后，这类注释就变作了谎言一堆。

The first comment in Listing 4-4 seems appropriate.2 It explains why the catch block is being ignored. But the second comment is pure noise. Apparently the programmer was just so frustrated with writing try/catch blocks in this function that he needed to vent.

> 代码清单 4-4 中的第一条注释貌似还行。它解释了 catch 代码块为何被忽略。不过第二条注释就纯是废话了。显然，该程序员沮丧于编写函数中那些 try/catch 代码块。

Listing 4-4 startSending

> 代码清单 4-4 startSending

```java
private void startSending() {
    try {
        doSending();
    } catch (SocketException e) {
        // normal. someone stopped the request.
    } catch (Exception e) {
        try {
            response.add(ErrorResponder.makeExceptionString(e));
            response.closeAll();
        } catch (Exception e1) {
            //Give me a break!
        }
    }
}
```

Rather than venting in a worthless and noisy comment, the programmer should have recognized that his frustration could be resolved by improving the structure of his code. He should have redirected his energy to extracting that last try/catch block into a separate function, as shown in Listing 4-5.

> 与其纠缠于毫无价值的废话注释，程序员应该意识到，他的挫败感可以由改进代码结构而消除。他应该把力气花在将最末一个 try/catch 代码块拆解到单独的函数中，如代码清单 4-5 所示。

Listing 4-5 startSending (refactored)

> 代码清单 4-5 startSending（重构之后）

```java
private void startSending() {
    try {
        doSending();
    } catch (SocketException e) {
        // normal. someone stopped the request.
    } catch (Exception e) {
        addExceptionAndCloseResponse(e);
    }
}

private void addExceptionAndCloseResponse(Exception e) {
    try {
        response.add(ErrorResponder.makeExceptionString(e));
        response.closeAll();
    } catch (Exception e1) {
    }
}
```

Replace the temptation to create noise with the determination to clean your code. You’ll find it makes you a better and happier programmer.

> 用整理代码的决心替代创造废话的冲动吧。你会发现自己成为更优秀、更快乐的程序员。

### 4.4.7 Scary Noise 可怕的废话

Javadocs can also be noisy. What purpose do the following Javadocs (from a well-known open-source library) serve? Answer: nothing. They are just redundant noisy comments written out of some misplaced desire to provide documentation.

> Javadoc 也可能是废话。下列 Javadoc（来自某知名开源库）的目的是什么？答案：无。它们只是源自某种提供文档的不当愿望的废话注释。

```java
/** The name. */
private String name;

/** The version. */
private String version;

/** The licenceName. */
private String licenceName;

/** The version. */
private String info;
```

Read these comments again more carefully. Do you see the cut-paste error? If authors aren’t paying attention when comments are written (or pasted), why should readers be expected to profit from them?

> 再仔细读读这些注释。你是否发现了剪切-粘贴错误？如果作者在写（或粘贴）注释时都没花心思，怎么能指望读者从中获益呢？

### 4.4.8 Don’t Use a Comment When You Can Use a Function or a Variable 能用函数或变量时就别用注释

Consider the following stretch of code:

> 看看以下代码概要：

```java
// does the module from the global list <mod> depend on the
// subsystem we are part of?
if (smodule.getDependSubsystems().contains(subSysMod.getSubSystem()))
```

This could be rephrased without the comment as

> 可以改成以下没有注释的版本：

```java
ArrayList moduleDependees = smodule.getDependSubsystems();
String ourSubSystem = subSysMod.getSubSystem();
if (moduleDependees.contains(ourSubSystem))
```

The author of the original code may have written the comment first (unlikely) and then written the code to fulfill the comment. However, the author should then have refactored the code, as I did, so that the comment could be removed.

> 代码原作者可能（不太像）是先写注释再编写代码。不过，作者应该重构代码，如我所做的那样，从而删掉注释。

### 4.4.9 Position Markers 位置标记

Sometimes programmers like to mark a particular position in a source file. For example, I recently found this in a program I was looking through:

> 有时，程序员喜欢在源代码中标记某个特别位置。例如，最近我在程序中看到这样一行：

```java
// Actions //////////////////////////////////
```

There are rare times when it makes sense to gather certain functions together beneath a banner like this. But in general they are clutter that should be eliminated—especially the noisy train of slashes at the end.

> 把特定函数趸放在这种标记栏下面，多数时候实属无理。鸡零狗碎，理当删除——特别是尾部那一长串无用的斜杠。

Think of it this way. A banner is startling and obvious if you don’t see banners very often. So use them very sparingly, and only when the benefit is significant. If you overuse banners, they’ll fall into the background noise and be ignored.

> 这么说吧。如果标记栏不多，就会显而易见。所以，尽量少用标记栏，只在特别有价值的时候用。如果滥用标记栏，就会沉没在背景噪音中，被忽略掉。

### 4.4.10 Closing Brace Comments 括号后面的注释

Sometimes programmers will put special comments on closing braces, as in Listing 4-6. Although this might make sense for long functions with deeply nested structures, it serves only to clutter the kind of small and encapsulated functions that we prefer. So if you find yourself wanting to mark your closing braces, try to shorten your functions instead.

> 有时，程序员会在括号后面放置特殊的注释，如代码清单 4-6 所示。尽管这对于含有深度嵌套结构的长函数可能有意义，但只会给我们更愿意编写的短小、封装的函数带来混乱。如果你发现自己想标记右括号，其实应该做的是缩短函数。

Listing 4-6 wc.java

> 代码清单 4-6 wc.java

```java
public class wc {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        String line;
        int lineCount = 0;
        int charCount = 0;
        int wordCount = 0;
        try {
            while ((line = in.readLine()) != null) {
                lineCount++;
                charCount += line.length();
                String words[] = line.split("\\W");
                wordCount += words.length;
            } //while
            System.out.println("wordCount = " + wordCount);
            System.out.println("lineCount = " + lineCount);
            System.out.println("charCount = " + charCount);
        } // try
        catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error:" + e.getMessage());
        } //catch
    } //main
}
```

### 4.4.11 Attributions and Bylines 归属与署名

```java
/* Added by Rick */
```

Source code control systems are very good at remembering who added what, when. There is no need to pollute the code with little bylines. You might think that such comments would be useful in order to help others know who to talk to about the code. But the reality is that they tend to stay around for years and years, getting less and less accurate and relevant.

> 源代码控制系统非常善于记住是谁在何时添加了什么。没必要用那些小小的签名搞脏代码。你也许会认为，这种注释大概有助于他人了解应该和谁讨论这段代码。不过，事实却是注释在那儿放了一年又一年，越来越不准确，越来越和原作者没关系。

Again, the source code control system is a better place for this kind of information.

> 重申一下，源代码控制系统是这类信息最好的归属地。

### 4.4.12 Commented-Out Code 注释掉的代码

Few practices are as odious as commenting-out code. Don’t do this!

> 直接把代码注释掉是讨厌的做法。别这么干！

```java
InputStreamResponse response = new InputStreamResponse();
response.setBody(formatter.getResultStream(), formatter.getByteCount());
// InputStream resultsStream = formatter.getResultStream();
// StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(resultsStream);
// response.setContent(reader.read(formatter.getByteCount()));
```

Others who see that commented-out code won’t have the courage to delete it. They’ll think it is there for a reason and is too important to delete. So commented-out code gathers like dregs at the bottom of a bad bottle of wine.

> 其他人不敢删除注释掉的代码。他们会想，代码依然放在那儿，一定有其原因，而且这段代码很重要，不能删除。注释掉的代码堆积在一起，就像破酒瓶底的渣滓一般。

Consider this from apache commons:

> 看看以下来自 Apache 公共库的代码：

```java
this.bytePos = writeBytes(pngIdBytes, 0);
//hdrPos = bytePos;
writeHeader();
writeResolution();
//dataPos = bytePos;
if (writeImageData()) {
    writeEnd();
    this.pngBytes = resizeByteArray(this.pngBytes, this.maxPos);
} else {
    this.pngBytes = null;
}
return this.pngBytes;
```

Why are those two lines of code commented? Are they important? Were they left as reminders for some imminent change? Or are they just cruft that someone commented-out years ago and has simply not bothered to clean up.

> 这两行代码为什么要注释掉？它们重要吗？它们搁在那儿，是为了给未来的修改做提示吗？或者，只是某人在多年以前注释掉、懒得清理的过时玩意？

There was a time, back in the sixties, when commenting-out code might have been useful. But we’ve had good source code control systems for a very long time now. Those systems will remember the code for us. We don’t have to comment it out any more. Just delete the code. We won’t lose it. Promise.

> 20 世纪 60 年代，曾经有那么一段时间，注释掉的代码可能有用。但我们已经拥有优良的源代码控制系统如此之久，这些系统可以为我们记住不要的代码。我们无需再用注释来标记，删掉即可，它们丢不了。我担保。

### 4.4.13 HTML Comments HTML 注释

HTML in source code comments is an abomination, as you can tell by reading the code below. It makes the comments hard to read in the one place where they should be easy to read—the editor/IDE. If comments are going to be extracted by some tool (like Javadoc) to appear in a Web page, then it should be the responsibility of that tool, and not the programmer, to adorn the comments with appropriate HTML.

> 源代码注释中的 HTML 标记是一种厌物，如你在下面代码中所见。编辑器/IDE 中的代码本来易于阅读，却因为 HTML 注释的存在而变得难以卒读。如果注释将由某种工具（例如 Javadoc）抽取出来，呈现到网页，那么该是工具而非程序员来负责给注释加上合适的 HTML 标签。

```java
/**
* Task to run fit tests.
* This task runs fitnesse tests and publishes the results.
* <p/>
* <pre>
* Usage:
* &lt;taskdef name=&quot;execute-fitnesse-tests&quot;
*     classname=&quot;fitnesse.ant.ExecuteFitnesseTestsTask&quot;
*     classpathref=&quot;classpath&quot; /&gt;
* OR
* &lt;taskdef classpathref=&quot;classpath&quot;
*             resource=&quot;tasks.properties&quot; /&gt;
* <p/>
* &lt;execute-fitnesse-tests
*     suitepage=&quot;FitNesse.SuiteAcceptanceTests&quot;
*     fitnesseport=&quot;8082&quot;
*     resultsdir=&quot;${results.dir}&quot;
*     resultshtmlpage=&quot;fit-results.html&quot;
*     classpathref=&quot;classpath&quot; /&gt;
* </pre>
*/
```

### 4.4.14 Nonlocal Information 非本地信息

If you must write a comment, then make sure it describes the code it appears near. Don’t offer systemwide information in the context of a local comment. Consider, for example, the javadoc comment below. Aside from the fact that it is horribly redundant, it also offers information about the default port. And yet the function has absolutely no control over what that default is. The comment is not describing the function, but some other, far distant part of the system. Of course there is no guarantee that this comment will be changed when the code containing the default is changed.

> 假如你一定要写注释，请确保它描述了离它最近的代码。别在本地注释的上下文环境中给出系统级的信息。以下面的 Javadoc 注释为例，除了那可怕的冗余之外，它还给出了有关默认端口的信息。不过该函数完全没控制到那个所谓默认值。这个注释并未描述该函数，而是在描述系统中远在他方的其他函数。当然，也无法担保在包含那个默认值的代码修改之后，这里的注释也会跟着修改。

```java
/**
 * Port on which fitnesse would run. Defaults to 8082.
 *
 * @param fitnessePort
 */
public void setFitnessePort(int fitnessePort) {
    this.fitnessePort = fitnessePort;
}
```

### 4.4.15 Too Much Information 信息过多

Don’t put interesting historical discussions or irrelevant descriptions of details into your comments. The comment below was extracted from a module designed to test that a function could encode and decode base64. Other than the RFC number, someone reading this code has no need for the arcane information contained in the comment.

> 别在注释中添加有趣的历史性话题或者无关的细节描述。下列注释来自某个用来测试 base64 编解码函数的模块。除了 RFC 文档编号之外，注释中的其他细节信息对于读者完全没有必要。

```java
/*
    RFC 2045 - Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)
    Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies
    section 6.8.  Base64 Content-Transfer-Encoding
    The encoding process represents 24-bit groups of input bits as output
    strings of 4 encoded characters. Proceeding from left to right, a
    24-bit input group is formed by concatenating 3 8-bit input groups.
    These 24 bits are then treated as 4 concatenated 6-bit groups, each
    of which is translated into a single digit in the base64 alphabet.
    When encoding a bit stream via the base64 encoding, the bit stream
    must be presumed to be ordered with the most-significant-bit first.
    That is, the first bit in the stream will be the high-order bit in
    the first 8-bit byte, and the eighth bit will be the low-order bit in
    the first 8-bit byte, and so on.
  */
```

### 4.4.16 Inobvious Connection 不明显的联系

The connection between a comment and the code it describes should be obvious. If you are going to the trouble to write a comment, then at least you’d like the reader to be able to look at the comment and the code and understand what the comment is talking about.

> 注释及其描述的代码之间的联系应该显而易见。如果你不嫌麻烦要写注释，至少让读者能看着注释和代码，并且理解注释所谈何物。

Consider, for example, this comment drawn from apache commons:

> 以来自 Apache 公共库的这段注释为例：

```java
/*
 * start with an array that is big enough to hold all the pixels
 * (plus filter bytes), and an extra 200 bytes for header info
 */
this.pngBytes = new byte[((this.width + 1) * this.height * 3) + 200];
```

What is a filter byte? Does it relate to the +1? Or to the \*3? Both? Is a pixel a byte? Why 200? The purpose of a comment is to explain code that does not explain itself. It is a pity when a comment needs its own explanation.

> 过滤器字节是什么？与那个+1 有关系吗？或与\*3 有关？还是与两者皆有关？为什么用 200？注释的作用是解释未能自行解释的代码。如果注释本身还需要解释，就太遗憾了。

### 4.4.17 Function Headers 函数头

Short functions don’t need much description. A well-chosen name for a small function that does one thing is usually better than a comment header.

> 短函数不需要太多描述。为只做一件事的短函数选个好名字，通常要比写函数头注释要好。

### 4.4.18 Javadocs in Nonpublic Code 非公共代码中的 Javadoc

As useful as javadocs are for public APIs, they are anathema to code that is not intended for public consumption. Generating javadoc pages for the classes and functions inside a system is not generally useful, and the extra formality of the javadoc comments amounts to little more than cruft and distraction.

> 虽然 Javadoc 对于公共 API 非常有用，但对于不打算作公共用途的代码就令人厌恶了。为系统中的类和函数生成 Javadoc 页并非总有用，而 Javadoc 注释额外的形式要求几乎等同于八股文章。

### 4.4.19 Example 范例

I wrote the module in Listing 4-7 for the first XP Immersion. It was intended to be an example of bad coding and commenting style. Kent Beck then refactored this code into a much more pleasant form in front of several dozen enthusiastic students. Later I adapted the example for my book Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices and the first of my Craftsman articles published in Software Development magazine.

> 我曾为首个 XP Immersion 课程编写了代码清单 4-7 列出的模块。这个模块几乎是糟糕的代码和坏注释风格的典范。后来 Kent Beck 当着几十位满腔热情的学生的面重构了这些代码，将其变得令人愉悦。后来，我在拙著 Agile Software Development，Principles，Patterns，and Practices（中译版《敏捷软件开发：原则、模式与实践》）和 Software Development（软件开发）杂志的“技艺”专栏的第一篇文章中引用了这个例子。

What I find fascinating about this module is that there was a time when many of us would have considered it “well documented.” Now we see it as a small mess. See how many different comment problems you can find.

> 这个模块最迷人的地方是，有那么一阵，我们中的许多人都认为它“文档做得很好”。如今，我们认为它是一小团乱麻。看看你能发现多少个不同的注释问题吧。

It is easy to argue that the first comment is redundant because it reads very much like the generatePrimes function itself. Still, I think the comment serves to ease the reader into the algorithm, so I’m inclined to leave it.

> 很容易说明，第一个注释完全是多余的，因为它读起来非常像是 generatePrimes 函数自身。不过，我认为这段注释还是省了读者去读具体算法的精力，所以我倾向于留下它。

The second argument is almost certainly necessary. It explains the rationale behind the use of the square root as the loop limit. I could find no simple variable name, nor any different coding structure that made this point clear. On the other hand, the use of the square root might be a conceit. Am I really saving that much time by limiting the iteration to the square root? Could the calculation of the square root take more time than I’m saving?

> 第二个注释显然很有必要。它解释了平方根作为循环限制的理由。我找不到能说明白这个问题的简单变量名或者其他编程结构。另外，对平方根的使用可能也有点武断。通过限制平方根循环，我是否真节省了许多时间？平方根计算所花的时间会不会比省下的时间还要多？

It’s worth thinking about. Using the square root as the iteration limit satisfies the old C and assembly language hacker in me, but I’m not convinced it’s worth the time and effort that everyone else will expend to understand it.

> 这些都值得考虑。使用平方根作为循环限制，满足了我这种旧式 C 语言和汇编语言黑客，不过我可不敢说抵得上其他人为理解它而花的时间和精力。
