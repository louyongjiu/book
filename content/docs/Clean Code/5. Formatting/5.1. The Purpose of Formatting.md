## 5.1 格式的目的

First of all, let’s be clear. Code formatting is important. It is too important to ignore and it is too important to treat religiously. Code formatting is about communication, and communication is the professional developer’s first order of business.

> 先明确一下，代码格式很重要。代码格式不可忽略，必须严肃对待。代码格式关乎沟通，而沟通是专业开发者的头等大事。

Perhaps you thought that “getting it working” was the first order of business for a professional developer. I hope by now, however, that this book has disabused you of that idea. The functionality that you create today has a good chance of changing in the next release, but the readability of your code will have a profound effect on all the changes that will ever be made. The coding style and readability set precedents that continue to affect maintainability and extensibility long after the original code has been changed beyond recognition. Your style and discipline survives, even though your code does not.

> 或许你认为“让代码能工作”才是专业开发者的头等大事。然而，我希望本书能让你抛掉那种想法。你今天编写的功能，极有可能在下一版本中被修改，但代码的可读性却会对以后可能发生的修改行为产生深远影响。原始代码修改之后很久，其代码风格和可读性仍会影响到可维护性和扩展性。即便代码已不复存在，你的风格和律条仍存活下来。

So what are the formatting issues that help us to communicate best?
