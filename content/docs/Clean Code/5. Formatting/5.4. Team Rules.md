## 5.4 团队规则

The title of this section is a play on words. Every programmer has his own favorite formatting rules, but if he works in a team, then the team rules.

> 每个程序员都有自己喜欢的格式规则，但如果在一个团队中工作，就是团队说了算。

A team of developers should agree upon a single formatting style, and then every member of that team should use that style. We want the software to have a consistent style. We don’t want it to appear to have been written by a bunch of disagreeing individuals.

> 一组开发者应当认同一种格式风格，每个成员都应该采用那种风格。我们想要让软件拥有一以贯之的风格。我们不想让它显得是由一大票意见相左的个人所写成。

When I started the FitNesse project back in 2002, I sat down with the team to work out a coding style. This took about 10 minutes. We decided where we’d put our braces, what our indent size would be, how we would name classes, variables, and methods, and so forth. Then we encoded those rules into the code formatter of our IDE and have stuck with them ever since. These were not the rules that I prefer; they were rules decided by the team. As a member of that team I followed them when writing code in the FitNesse project.

> 002 年启动 FitNesse 项目时，我和开发团队一起制订了一套编码风格。这只花了我们 10 分钟时间。我们决定了在什么地方放置括号，缩进几个字符，如何命名类、变量和方法，如此等等。然后，我们把这些规则编写进 IDE 的代码格式功能，接着就一直沿用。这些规则并非全是我喜爱的；但它们是团队决定了的规则。作为团队一员，在为 FitNesse 项目编写代码时，我遵循这些规则。

Remember, a good software system is composed of a set of documents that read nicely. They need to have a consistent and smooth style. The reader needs to be able to trust that the formatting gestures he or she has seen in one source file will mean the same thing in others. The last thing we want to do is add more complexity to the source code by writing it in a jumble of different individual styles.

> 记住，好的软件系统是由一系列读起来不错的代码文件组成的。它们需要拥有一致和顺畅的风格。读者要能确信，他们在一个源文件中看到的格式风格在其他文件中也是同样的用法。绝对不要用各种不同的风格来编写源代码，这样会增加其复杂度。
