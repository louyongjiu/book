# 第 5 章 格式

![](/cc/figures/ch5/5_1fig_martin.jpg)

When people look under the hood, we want them to be impressed with the neatness, consistency, and attention to detail that they perceive. We want them to be struck by the orderliness. We want their eyebrows to rise as they scroll through the modules. We want them to perceive that professionals have been at work. If instead they see a scrambled mass of code that looks like it was written by a bevy of drunken sailors, then they are likely to conclude that the same inattention to detail pervades every other aspect of the project.

> 当有人查看底层代码实现时，我们希望他们为其整洁、一致及所感知到的对细节的关注而震惊。我们希望他们高高扬起眉毛，一路看下去。我们希望他们感受到那些为之劳作的专业人士们。但若他们看到的只是一堆像是由酒醉的水手写出的鬼画符，那他们多半会得出结论，认为项目其他任何部分也同样对细节漠不关心。

You should take care that your code is nicely formatted. You should choose a set of simple rules that govern the format of your code, and then you should consistently apply those rules. If you are working on a team, then the team should agree to a single set of formatting rules and all members should comply. It helps to have an automated tool that can apply those formatting rules for you.

> 你应该保持良好的代码格式。你应该选用一套管理代码格式的简单规则，然后贯彻这些规则。如果你在团队中工作，则团队应该一致同意采用一套简单的格式规则，所有成员都要遵从。使用能帮你应用这些格式规则的自动化工具会很有帮助。
