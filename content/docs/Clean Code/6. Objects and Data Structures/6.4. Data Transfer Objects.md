## 6.4 数据传送对象

The quintessential form of a data structure is a class with public variables and no functions. This is sometimes called a data transfer object, or DTO. DTOs are very useful structures, especially when communicating with databases or parsing messages from sockets, and so on. They often become the first in a series of translation stages that convert raw data in a database into objects in the application code.

> 最为精练的数据结构，是一个只有公共变量、没有函数的类。这种数据结构有时被称为数据传送对象，或 DTO（Data Transfer Objects）。 DTO 是非常有用的结构，尤其是在与数据库通信、或解析套接字传递的消息之类场景中。在应用程序代码里一系列将原始数据转换为数据库的翻译过程中，它们往往是排头兵。

Somewhat more common is the “bean” form shown in Listing 6-7. Beans have private variables manipulated by getters and setters. The quasi-encapsulation of beans seems to make some OO purists feel better but usually provides no other benefit.

> 更常见的是如代码清单 6-7 所示的“豆”（bean）结构。豆结构拥有由赋值器和取值器操作的私有变量。对豆结构的半封装会让某些 OO 纯化论者感觉舒服些，不过通常没有其他好处。

Listing 6-7 address.java

> 代码清单 6-7 address.java

```java
public class Address {
    private String street;
    private String streetExtra;
    private String city;
    private String state;
    private String zip;

    public Address(String street, String streetExtra,
                   String city, String state, String zip) {
        this.street = street;
        this.streetExtra = streetExtra;
        this.city = city;
        this.state = state;
        this.zip = zip;
    }

    public String getStreet() {
        return street;
    }

    public String getStreetExtra() {
        return streetExtra;
    }

    public String getCity() {
        return city;
    }

    public String getState() {
        return state;
    }

    public String getZip() {
        return zip;
    }
}
```

### Active Record

Active Records are special forms of DTOs. They are data structures with public (or bean-accessed) variables; but they typically have navigational methods like save and find. Typically these Active Records are direct translations from database tables, or other data sources.

> Active Record 是一种特殊的 DTO 形式。它们是拥有公共（或可豆式访问的）变量的数据结构，但通常也会拥有类似 save 和 find 这样的可浏览方法。Active Record 一般是对数据库表或其他数据源的直接翻译。

Unfortunately we often find that developers try to treat these data structures as though they were objects by putting business rule methods in them. This is awkward because it creates a hybrid between a data structure and an object.

> 我们不幸经常发现开发者往这类数据结构中塞进业务规则方法，把这类数据结构当成对象来用。这是不智的行为，因为它导致了数据结构和对象的混杂体。

The solution, of course, is to treat the Active Record as a data structure and to create separate objects that contain the business rules and that hide their internal data (which are probably just instances of the Active Record).

> 当然，解决方案就是把 Active Record 当做数据结构，并创建包含业务规则、隐藏内部数据（可能就是 Active Record 的实体）的独立对象。
