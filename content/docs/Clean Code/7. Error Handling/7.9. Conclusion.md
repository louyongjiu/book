## 7.9 小结

Clean code is readable, but it must also be robust. These are not conflicting goals. We can write robust clean code if we see error handling as a separate concern, something that is viewable independently of our main logic. To the degree that we are able to do that, we can reason about it independently, and we can make great strides in the maintainability of our code.

> 整洁代码是可读的，但也要强固。可读与强固并不冲突。如果将错误处理隔离看待，独立于主要逻辑之外，就能写出强固而整洁的代码。做到这一步，我们就能单独处理它，也极大地提升了代码的可维护性。
