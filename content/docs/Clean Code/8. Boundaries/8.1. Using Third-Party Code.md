## 8.1 使用第三方代码

There is a natural tension between the provider of an interface and the user of an interface. Providers of third-party packages and frameworks strive for broad applicability so they can work in many environments and appeal to a wide audience. Users, on the other hand, want an interface that is focused on their particular needs. This tension can cause problems at the boundaries of our systems.

> 在接口提供者和使用者之间，存在与生俱来的张力。第三方程序包和框架提供者追求普适性，这样就能在多个环境中工作，吸引广泛的用户。而使用者则想要集中满足特定需求的接口。这种张力会导致系统边界上出现问题。

Let’s look at java.util.Map as an example. As you can see by examining Figure 8-1, Maps have a very broad interface with plenty of capabilities. Certainly this power and flexibility is useful, but it can also be a liability. For instance, our application might build up a Map and pass it around. Our intention might be that none of the recipients of our Map delete anything in the map. But right there at the top of the list is the clear() method. Any user of the Map has the power to clear it. Or maybe our design convention is that only particular types of objects can be stored in the Map, but Maps do not reliably constrain the types of objects placed within them. Any determined user can add items of any type to any Map.

> 以 java.util.Map 为例。如你在表 8-1 中所见，Map 有着广阔的接口和丰富的功能。当然，这种力量和灵活性很有用，但也要付出代价。比如，应用程序可能构造一个 Map 对象并传递它。我们的初衷可能是 Map 对象的所有接收者都不要删除映射图中的任何东西。但表 8-1 的顶端却正好有一个 clear( )方法。Map 的任何使用者都能清除映射图。或许设计惯例是 Map 中只能保存特定的类型，但 Map 并不会可靠地约束存于其中的对象的类型。使用者可随意往 Map 中塞入任何类型的条目。

If our application needs a Map of Sensors, you might find the sensors set up like this:

> 如果你的应用程序需要一个包容 Sensor 类对象的 Map 映射图，大概会是这样：

```java
Map sensors = new HashMap();
```

Then, when some other part of the code needs to access the sensor, you see this code:

> 当代码的其他部分需要访问这些 sensor，就会有这行代码：

```java
Sensor s = (Sensor)sensors.get(sensorId);
```

We don’t just see it once, but over and over again throughout the code. The client of this code carries the responsibility of getting an Object from the Map and casting it to the right type. This works, but it’s not clean code. Also, this code does not tell its story as well as it could. The readability of this code can be greatly improved by using generics, as shown below:

> 这行代码一再出现。代码的调用端承担了从 Map 中取得对象并将其转换为正确类型的职责。行倒是行，却并非整洁的代码。而且，这行代码并未说明自己的用途。通过对泛型的使用，这段代码可读性可以大大提高，如下所示：

```java
Map<Sensor> sensors = new HashMap<Sensor>();
…
Sensor s = sensors.get(sensorId);
```

However, this doesn’t solve the problem that `Map<Sensor>` provides more capability than we need or want.

> 不过，`Map<Sensor>` 提供了超出所需/所愿的功能的问题，仍未得到解决。

Passing an instance of `Map<Sensor>` liberally around the system means that there will be a lot of places to fix if the interface to Map ever changes. You might think such a change to be unlikely, but remember that it changed when generics support was added in Java 5. Indeed, we’ve seen systems that are inhibited from using generics because of the sheer magnitude of changes needed to make up for the liberal use of Maps.

> 在系统中不受限制地传递`Map<Sensor>`的实体，意味着当到 Map 的接口被修改时，有许多地方都要跟着改。你或许会认为这样的改动不太可能发生，不过，当 Java 5 加入对泛型的支持时，的确发生了改动。我们也的确见到一些系统因为要做大量改动才能自由使用 Map 类，而无法使用泛型。

A cleaner way to use Map might look like the following. No user of Sensors would care one bit if generics were used or not. That choice has become (and always should be) an implementation detail.

> 使用 Map 的更整洁的方式大致如下。Sensors 的用户不必关心是否用了泛型，那将是（也该是）实现细节才关心的。

```java
public class Sensors {
   private Map sensors = new HashMap();

   public Sensor getById(String id) {
      return (Sensor) sensors.get(id);
   }

   //snip
}
```

The interface at the boundary (Map) is hidden. It is able to evolve with very little impact on the rest of the application. The use of generics is no longer a big issue because the casting and type management is handled inside the Sensors class.

> 边界上的接口（Map）是隐藏的。它能随来自应用程序其他部分的极小的影响而变动。对泛型的使用不再是个大问题，因为转换和类型管理是在 Sensors 类内部处理的。

This interface is also tailored and constrained to meet the needs of the application. It results in code that is easier to understand and harder to misuse. The Sensors class can enforce design and business rules.

> 该接口也经过仔细修整和归置以适应应用程序的需要。结果就是得到易于理解、难以被误用的代码。Sensors 类推动了设计和业务的规则。我们并不建议总是以这种方式封装 Map 的使用。

We are not suggesting that every use of Map be encapsulated in this form. Rather, we are advising you not to pass Maps (or any other interface at a boundary) around your system. If you use a boundary interface like Map, keep it inside the class, or close family of classes, where it is used. Avoid returning it from, or accepting it as an argument to, public APIs.

> 我们建议不要将 Map（或在边界上的其他接口）在系统中传递。如果你使用类似 Map 这样的边界接口，就把它保留在类或近亲类中。避免从公共 API 中返回边界接口，或将边界接口作为参数传递给公共 API。
