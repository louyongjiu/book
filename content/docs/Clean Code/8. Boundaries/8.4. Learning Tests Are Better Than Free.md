## 8.4 学习性测试的好处不只是免费

The learning tests end up costing nothing. We had to learn the API anyway, and writing those tests was an easy and isolated way to get that knowledge. The learning tests were precise experiments that helped increase our understanding.

> 学习性测试毫无成本。无论如何我们都得学习要使用的 API，而编写测试则是获得这些知识的容易而不会影响其他工作的途径。学习性测试是一种精确试验，帮助我们增进对 API 的理解。

Not only are learning tests free, they have a positive return on investment. When there are new releases of the third-party package, we run the learning tests to see whether there are behavioral differences.

> 学习性测试不光免费，还在投资上有正面的回报。当第三方程序包发布了新版本，我们可以运行学习性测试，看看程序包的行为有没有改变。

Learning tests verify that the third-party packages we are using work the way we expect them to. Once integrated, there are no guarantees that the third-party code will stay compatible with our needs. The original authors will have pressures to change their code to meet new needs of their own. They will fix bugs and add new capabilities. With each release comes new risk. If the third-party package changes in some way incompatible with our tests, we will find out right away.

> 学习性测试确保第三方程序包按照我们想要的方式工作。一旦整合进来，就不能保证第三方代码总与我们的需要兼容。原作者不得不修改代码来满足他们自己的新需要。他们会修正缺陷、添加新功能。风险伴随新版本而来。如果第三方程序包的修改与测试不兼容，我们也能马上发现。

Whether you need the learning provided by the learning tests or not, a clean boundary should be supported by a set of outbound tests that exercise the interface the same way the production code does. Without these boundary tests to ease the migration, we might be tempted to stay with the old version longer than we should.

> 无论你是否需要通过学习性测试来学习，总要有一系列与生产代码中调用方式一致的输出测试来支持整洁的边界。不使用这些边界测试来减轻迁移的劳力，我们可能会超出应有时限，长久地绑在旧版本上面。
