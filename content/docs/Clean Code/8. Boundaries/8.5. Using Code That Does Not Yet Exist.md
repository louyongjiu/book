## 8.5 使用尚不存在的代码

There is another kind of boundary, one that separates the known from the unknown. There are often places in the code where our knowledge seems to drop off the edge. Sometimes what is on the other side of the boundary is unknowable (at least right now). Sometimes we choose to look no farther than the boundary.

> 还有另一种边界，那种将已知和未知分隔开的边界。在代码中总有许多地方是我们的知识未及之处。有时，边界那边就是未知的（至少目前未知）。有时，我们并不往边界那边看过去。

A number of years back I was part of a team developing software for a radio communications system. There was a subsystem, the “Transmitter,” that we knew little about, and the people responsible for the subsystem had not gotten to the point of defining their interface. We did not want to be blocked, so we started our work far away from the unknown part of the code.

> 好多年以前，我曾在一个开发无线通信系统软件的团队中工作。该系统有个子系统 Transmitter（发送机）。我们对 Transmitter 知之甚少，而该子系统的开发者还没有对接口进行定义。我们不想受这种事阻碍，就从距未知那部分代码很远处开始工作。

We had a pretty good idea of where our world ended and the new world began. As we worked, we sometimes bumped up against this boundary. Though mists and clouds of ignorance obscured our view beyond the boundary, our work made us aware of what we wanted the boundary interface to be. We wanted to tell the transmitter something like this:

> 对于我们的世界如何结束、新世界如何开始，我们有许多好主意。工作时，我们偶尔会跨越那道边界。尽管云雾遮挡了我们看向边界那边的视线，我们还是从工作中了解到我们想要的边界接口是什么样的。我们想要告知发送机一些事：

Key the transmitter on the provided frequency and emit an analog representation of the data coming from this stream.

> 对于我们的世界如何结束、新世界如何开始，我们有许多好主意。工作时，我们偶尔会跨越那道边界。

We had no idea how that would be done because the API had not been designed yet. So we decided to work out the details later.

> 尽管云雾遮挡了我们看向边界那边的视线，我们还是从工作中了解到我们想要的边界接口是什么样的。我们想要告知发送机一些事：

To keep from being blocked, we defined our own interface. We called it something catchy, like Transmitter. We gave it a method called transmit that took a frequency and a data stream. This was the interface we wished we had.

> 为了不受阻碍，我们定义了自己使用的接口。我们给它取了个好记的名字，比如 Transmitter。我们给它写了个名为 transmit 的方法，获取频率参数和数据流。这就是我们希望得到的接口。

One good thing about writing the interface we wish we had is that it’s under our control. This helps keep client code more readable and focused on what it is trying to accomplish.

> 编写我们想得到的接口，好处之一是它在我们控制之下。这有助于保持客户代码更可读，且集中于它该完成的工作。

In Figure 8-2, you can see that we insulated the CommunicationsController classes from the transmitter API (which was out of our control and undefined). By using our own application specific interface, we kept our CommunicationsController code clean and expressive. Once the transmitter API was defined, we wrote the TransmitterAdapter to bridge the gap. The ADAPTER2 encapsulated the interaction with the API and provides a single place to change when the API evolves.

> 在图 8-2 中可以看到，我们将 CommunicationsController 类从发送器 API（该 API 不受我们控制，而且还没定义）中隔离出来。通过使用符合应用程序的接口，CommunicationsController 代码整洁且足以表达其意图。一旦发送器 API 被定义出来，我们就编写 TransmitterAdapter 来跨接。ADAPTER 封装了与 API 的互动，也提供了一个当 API 发生变动时唯一需要改动的地方。

This design also gives us a very convenient seam3 in the code for testing. Using a suitable FakeTransmitter, we can test the CommunicationsController classes. We can also create boundary tests once we have the TransmitterAPI that make sure we are using the API correctly.

> 这套设计方案为测试提供了一种极为方便的接缝。使用适当的 FakeTransmitter，我们就能测试 CommunicationsController 类。在拿到 TransmitterAPI 时，我们也能创建确保正确使用 API 的边界测试。
