## 8.6 整洁的边界

Interesting things happen at boundaries. Change is one of those things. Good software designs accommodate change without huge investments and rework. When we use code that is out of our control, special care must be taken to protect our investment and make sure future change is not too costly.

> 边界上会发生有趣的事。改动是其中之一。有良好的软件设计，无需巨大投入和重写即可进行修改。在使用我们控制不了的代码时，必须加倍小心保护投资，确保未来的修改不至于代价太大。

Code at the boundaries needs clear separation and tests that define expectations. We should avoid letting too much of our code know about the third-party particulars. It’s better to depend on something you control than on something you don’t control, lest it end up controlling you.

> 边界上的代码需要清晰的分割和定义了期望的测试。应该避免我们的代码过多地了解第三方代码中的特定信息。依靠你能控制的东西，好过依靠你控制不了的东西，免得日后受它控制。

We manage third-party boundaries by having very few places in the code that refer to them. We may wrap them as we did with Map, or we may use an ADAPTER to convert from our perfect interface to the provided interface. Either way our code speaks to us better, promotes internally consistent usage across the boundary, and has fewer maintenance points when the third-party code changes.

> 我们通过代码中少数几处引用第三方边界接口的位置来管理第三方边界。可以像我们对待 Map 那样包装它们，也可以使用 ADAPTER 模式将我们的接口转换为第三方提供的接口。采用这两种方式，代码都能更好地与我们沟通，在边界两边推动内部一致的用法，当第三方代码有改动时修改点也会更少。
