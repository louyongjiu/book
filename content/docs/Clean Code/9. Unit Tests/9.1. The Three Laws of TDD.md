## 9.1 三定律

By now everyone knows that TDD asks us to write unit tests first, before we write production code. But that rule is just the tip of the iceberg. Consider the following three laws:

> 谁都知道 TDD 要求我们在编写生产代码前先编写单元测试。但这条规则只是冰山之巅。看看下列三定律：

First Law You may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test.

> 定律一 在编写不能通过的单元测试前，不可编写生产代码。

Second Law You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.

> 定律二 只可编写刚好无法通过的单元测试，不能编译也算不通过。

Third Law You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test.

> 定律三 只可编写刚好足以通过当前失败测试的生产代码。

These three laws lock you into a cycle that is perhaps thirty seconds long. The tests and the production code are written together, with the tests just a few seconds ahead of the production code.

> 这三条定律将你限制在大概 30 秒一个的循环中。测试与生产代码一起编写，测试只比生产代码早写几秒钟。

If we work this way, we will write dozens of tests every day, hundreds of tests every month, and thousands of tests every year. If we work this way, those tests will cover virtually all of our production code. The sheer bulk of those tests, which can rival the size of the production code itself, can present a daunting management problem.

> 这样写程序，我们每天就会编写数十个测试，每个月编写数百个测试，每年编写数千个测试。这样写程序，测试将覆盖所有生产代码。测试代码量足以匹敌生产代码量，导致令人生畏的管理问题。
