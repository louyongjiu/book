## 9.2 保持测试整洁

Some years back I was asked to coach a team who had explicitly decided that their test code should not be maintained to the same standards of quality as their production code. They gave each other license to break the rules in their unit tests. “Quick and dirty” was the watchword. Their variables did not have to be well named, their test functions did not need to be short and descriptive. Their test code did not need to be well designed and thoughtfully partitioned. So long as the test code worked, and so long as it covered the production code, it was good enough.

> 几年前，有人请我去指导一个开发团队。那个团队认定，测试代码的维护不应遵循生产代码的质量标准。他们彼此默许在单元测试中破坏规矩。“速而不周”成了团队格言。变量命名不用好，测试函数不必短小和具有描述性。测试代码不必做良好设计和仔细划分。只要测试代码还能工作，只要还覆盖着生产代码，就足够好。

Some of you reading this might sympathize with that decision. Perhaps, long in the past, you wrote tests of the kind that I wrote for that Timer class. It’s a huge step from writing that kind of throw-away test, to writing a suite of automated unit tests. So, like the team I was coaching, you might decide that having dirty tests is better than having no tests.

> 有些读者可能会同意这种做法。或许，在很久以前，你也用过我为那个 Timer 类写测试的方法。从编写那种用后即扔的测试到编写全套自动化单元测试是一大进步。所以，就像那个我指导过的团队一样，你或许也会认为脏测试好过没测试。

What this team did not realize was that having dirty tests is equivalent to, if not worse than, having no tests. The problem is that tests must change as the production code evolves. The dirtier the tests, the harder they are to change. The more tangled the test code, the more likely it is that you will spend more time cramming new tests into the suite than it takes to write the new production code. As you modify the production code, old tests start to fail, and the mess in the test code makes it hard to get those tests to pass again. So the tests become viewed as an ever-increasing liability.

> 这个团队没有意识到的是，脏测试等同于——如果不是坏于的话 ——没测试。问题在于，测试必须随生产代码的演进而修改。测试越脏，就越难修改。测试代码越缠结，你就越有可能花更多时间塞进新测试，而不是编写新生产代码。修改生产代码后，旧测试就会开始失败，而测试代码中乱七八糟的东西将阻碍代码再次通过。于是，测试变得就像是不断翻番的债务。

From release to release the cost of maintaining my team’s test suite rose. Eventually it became the single biggest complaint among the developers. When managers asked why their estimates were getting so large, the developers blamed the tests. In the end they were forced to discard the test suite entirely.

随着版本递进，团队维护测试代码组的代价也在上升。最终，它变成了开发者最大的抱怨对象。当经理们问及为何超支如此巨大，开发者们就归咎于测试。最后，他们只能扔掉了整个测试代码组。

But, without a test suite they lost the ability to make sure that changes to their code base worked as expected. Without a test suite they could not ensure that changes to one part of their system did not break other parts of their system. So their defect rate began to rise. As the number of unintended defects rose, they started to fear making changes. They stopped cleaning their production code because they feared the changes would do more harm than good. Their production code began to rot. In the end they were left with no tests, tangled and bug-riddled production code, frustrated customers, and the feeling that their testing effort had failed them.

> 但是，没有了测试代码组，他们就失去了确保对代码的改动能如愿工作的能力。没有了测试代码组，他们就无法确保对系统某个部分的修改不会影响到系统的其他部分。故障率开始增加。随着并非出自有意的故障越来越多，他们开始害怕做改动。他们不再清理生产代码，因为他们害怕修改带来的损害多于收益。生产代码开始腐坏。最后，他们只剩下没有测试、纷乱而缺陷缠身的生产代码，沮丧的客户，还有对测试的失望。

In a way they were right. Their testing effort had failed them. But it was their decision to allow the tests to be messy that was the seed of that failure. Had they kept their tests clean, their testing effort would not have failed. I can say this with some certainty because I have participated in, and coached, many teams who have been successful with clean unit tests.

> 在某种意义上，他们说对了。测试的确让他们失望。不过是他们自己决定让测试变得乱七八糟的，而那正是失败的根源。如果他们保持测试整洁，测试就不会令他们失望。我可以拍着胸脯这么说，因为我曾经参与并指导了多个凭借整洁单元测试获得成功的团队。

The moral of the story is simple: Test code is just as important as production code. It is not a second-class citizen. It requires thought, design, and care. It must be kept as clean as production code.

> 故事的寓意很简单：测试代码和生产代码一样重要。它可不是二等公民。它需要被思考、被设计和被照料。它该像生产代码一般保持整洁。

### Tests Enable the -ilities 测试带来一切好处

If you don’t keep your tests clean, you will lose them. And without them, you lose the very thing that keeps your production code flexible. Yes, you read that correctly. It is unit tests that keep our code flexible, maintainable, and reusable. The reason is simple. If you have tests, you do not fear making changes to the code! Without tests every change is a possible bug. No matter how flexible your architecture is, no matter how nicely partitioned your design, without tests you will be reluctant to make changes because of the fear that you will introduce undetected bugs.

> 如果测试不能保持整洁，你就会失去它们。没有了测试，你就会失去保证生产代码可扩展的一切要素。你没看错。正是单元测试让你的代码可扩展、可维护、可复用。原因很简单。有了测试，你就不担心对代码的修改！没有测试，每次修改都可能带来缺陷。无论架构多有扩展性，无论设计划分得有多好，没有了测试，你就很难做改动，因为你担忧改动会引入不可预知的缺陷。

But with tests that fear virtually disappears. The higher your test coverage, the less your fear. You can make changes with near impunity to code that has a less than stellar architecture and a tangled and opaque design. Indeed, you can improve that architecture and design without fear!

> 有了测试，愁云一扫而空。测试覆盖率越高，你就越不担心。哪怕是对于那种架构并不优秀、设计晦涩纠缠的代码，你也能近乎没有后患地做修改。实际上，你能毫无顾虑地改进架构和设计！

So having an automated suite of unit tests that cover the production code is the key to keeping your design and architecture as clean as possible. Tests enable all the -ilities, because tests enable change.

> 所以，覆盖了生产代码的自动化单元测试程序组能尽可能地保持设计和架构的整洁。测试带来了一切好处，因为测试使改动变得可能。

So if your tests are dirty, then your ability to change your code is hampered, and you begin to lose the ability to improve the structure of that code. The dirtier your tests, the dirtier your code becomes. Eventually you lose the tests, and your code rots.

> 如果测试不干净，你改动自己代码的能力就有所牵制，而你也会开始失去改进代码结构的能力。测试越脏，代码就会变得越脏。最终，你丢失了测试，代码开始腐坏。
