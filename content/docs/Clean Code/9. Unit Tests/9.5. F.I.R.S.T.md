## 9.5 F.I.R.S.T.

Clean tests follow five other rules that form the above acronym:

> 整洁的测试还遵循以下 5 条规则，这 5 条规则的首字母构成了本节标题：

Fast Tests should be fast. They should run quickly. When tests run slow, you won’t want to run them frequently. If you don’t run them frequently, you won’t find problems early enough to fix them easily. You won’t feel as free to clean up the code. Eventually the code will begin to rot.

> 快速（Fast）测试应该够快。测试应该能快速运行。测试运行缓慢，你就不会想要频繁地运行它。如果你不频繁运行测试，就不能尽早发现问题，也无法轻易修正，从而也不能轻而易举地清理代码。最终，代码就会腐坏。

Independent Tests should not depend on each other. One test should not set up the conditions for the next test. You should be able to run each test independently and run the tests in any order you like. When tests depend on each other, then the first one to fail causes a cascade of downstream failures, making diagnosis difficult and hiding downstream defects.

> 独立（Independent）测试应该相互独立。某个测试不应为下一个测试设定条件。你应该可以单独运行每个测试，及以任何顺序运行测试。当测试互相依赖时，头一个没通过就会导致一连串的测试失败，使问题诊断变得困难，隐藏了下级错误。

Repeatable Tests should be repeatable in any environment. You should be able to run the tests in the production environment, in the QA environment, and on your laptop while riding home on the train without a network. If your tests aren’t repeatable in any environment, then you’ll always have an excuse for why they fail. You’ll also find yourself unable to run the tests when the environment isn’t available.

> 可重复（Repeatable）测试应当可在任何环境中重复通过。你应该能够在生产环境、质检环境中运行测试，也能够在无网络的列车上用笔记本电脑运行测试。如果测试不能在任意环境中重复，你就总会有个解释其失败的接口。当环境条件不具备时，你也会无法运行测试。

Self-Validating The tests should have a boolean output. Either they pass or fail. You should not have to read through a log file to tell whether the tests pass. You should not have to manually compare two different text files to see whether the tests pass. If the tests aren’t self-validating, then failure can become subjective and running the tests can require a long manual evaluation.

> 自足验证（Self-Validating）测试应该有布尔值输出。无论是通过或失败，你不应该查看日志文件来确认测试是否通过。你不应该手工对比两个不同文本文件来确认测试是否通过。如果测试不能自足验证，对失败的判断就会变得依赖主观，而运行测试也需要更长的手工操作时间。

Timely The tests need to be written in a timely fashion. Unit tests should be written just before the production code that makes them pass. If you write tests after the production code, then you may find the production code to be hard to test. You may decide that some production code is too hard to test. You may not design the production code to be testable.

> 及时（Timely）测试应及时编写。单元测试应该恰好在使其通过的生产代码之前编写。如果在编写生产代码之后编写测试，你会发现生产代码难以测试。你可能会认为某些生产代码本身难以测试。你可能不会去设计可测试的代码。
