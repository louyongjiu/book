## 9.6 小结

We have barely scratched the surface of this topic. Indeed, I think an entire book could be written about clean tests. Tests are as important to the health of a project as the production code is. Perhaps they are even more important, because tests preserve and enhance the flexibility, maintainability, and reusability of the production code. So keep your tests constantly clean. Work to make them expressive and succinct. Invent testing APIs that act as domain-specific language that helps you write the tests.

> 我们只是触及了这个话题的表面。实际上，我认为应该为整洁的测试写上一整本书。对于项目的健康度，测试盒生产代码同等重要。或许测试更为重要，因为它保证和增强了生产代码的可扩展性、可维护性和可复用性。所以，保持测试整洁吧。让测试具有表达力并短小精悍。发明作为面向特定领域语言的测试 API，帮助自己编写测试。

If you let the tests rot, then your code will rot too. Keep your tests clean.

> 如果你坐视测试腐坏，那么代码也会跟着腐坏。保持测试整洁吧。
